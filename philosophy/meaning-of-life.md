> This isn’t like scientific inquiry or like solving an equation where there’s a right answer you have to find. This isn’t about answering questions or solving problems, it’s about destroying them. It’s about seeing a question or problem with perfect clarity, which makes it disappear as if it never was.. Ultimately, no answer is possible and the question itself disintegrates under scrutiny. All questions do. Everything disintegrates under scrutiny. - Jed

Excuse the trite subject. "What is the meaning of life?" (WitMoL) feels cliche & overdone. I've thought enough about this Questions that I've seen it disintegrate in a few different ways & wanted to share some of them.

What does it mean for a question to disintegrate under scrutiny? "What is the meaning of life?" seems like a fun question to scrutinize, let's do so & see what happens.

Like most mystical & "deep" questions, this one is only vague & mysterious because it hinges on a few poorly defined words. Everyone thinks they know what life and meaning are but if we dig in a bit we'll see that common definitions for these cannot be made very precise.

# Life

What is life? Common definitions include specifications that an Alive Thing:
 - Consumes energy of some sort (sunlight, other Alive Things, sulphur from hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, etc)
 - Reproduces to generate more Alive Things (either on it's own or w the help of a partner)
 - Has some internal state that's highly ordered & kept in equilibrium w it's environment (body temp is kept w/in some range, etc)

What about a 3D printer? It consumes energy, can create new copies of itself, and has a highly ordered internal state. Check, check, check. But putting a 3D printer in the Alive Things category isn't super useful.

But what if we humans get good at bio-engineering and manage to create a bio-robot. An Alive-ish thing that's based on human DNA; it can eat and breath and reproduce but which has no agency of it's own. It can think & solve math problems if asked to, but it cannot initiate any action without input from it's commander.

Is it useful to label this thing as Alive? Maybe, but probably not. For most purposes, agency ie something akin to free-will (a soul?!) is an important component of what we consider to be Life.

# Meaning

In the case of a bio-robot created to tend to a farm, the WitMoL question seems pretty straight forward. It's meaning in life is to farm. It was created with one purpose in mind.

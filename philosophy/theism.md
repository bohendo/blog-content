# A New Theism

I believe in God.

I do not, however, regularly visit any Christian Churches or Hindu Temples. I do see Christians & Hindus as being my allies in today's cultural cold war, my generation's dharamyudh, but for the most part I see traditional religion as being badly outdated & outgunned. Christianity in it's present form is no match for progressive atheism.

I believe that traditional religion must die & be reborn as something better, stronger, and truer if Good wants to have a fighting chance against Evil.

I was raised amongst Christians & I spent ~3 years living in India amongst Hindus. Superficially, these two religions appear quite different but where they align, that's where the purest truths are most likely to be found.

My worldview is still a work in progress, it will always be a work in progress, but as I gained exposure to a diverse collection of worldviews, some very fundamental aspects of my own worldview have started to cool, harden, and crystallize.

I present several theistic idea-crystals below. If any of them can be destroyed by the truth, they deserve to be destroyed by the truth.

Reader beware: when truth & lies come together the lies are not only destroyed, they are revealed to have never been in the first place. If you like being an atheist and would prefer to remain one, I recommend you close this article now. If, on the other hand, you have unshakable faith in godlessness or if you are open-minded enough that the idea of believing in God doesn't horrify you, proceed with caution.

The word for someone who does so is heretic, and historically the punishments reserved for him are more brutal than for any other class of offender." - Jed McKenna

## God is Infinite & Perfect

We humans are "like" God except that we are finite and imperfect.

The Hindu Brahman is probably a better fit for what I'm calling God here. The Christian notion of God is watered down by finite men & mysterious ghosts whereas the true God can neither be confined to a mortal body nor is He fundamentally mysterious.

[Jed McKenna's Creation Myth](https://youtu.be/9Njhgz5Hspw?t=30) is the most concise & beautiful creation myth I've encountered so far.

## The Universe is the mind of God

This realization cleanly assigns responsibilities for science & theology: Science is the study of our universe, theology is the study of everything beyond our universe. There can therefore be no conflict between theology & science unless one of these two is grossly misrepresented.

"Science is to psychology as Theology is to neuroscience" but from the viewpoint of a psychological construct who exists on a different plane of existence than the physical brain that's dreaming them up.

A man wondering "What is the nature of God?" is analogous to me dreaming up a pink elephant in my mind's eye who is wondering "What is the nature of the brain that created me?"

The atheist answer to "What contains our universe?" is some variation on "It's turtles all the way down" except usually with meta-verses or tiny strings or something instead of turtles. No, it's not turtles or strings or anything all the way down. There is a floor and that floor is God.

"But what evidence do you have that God exists?!" The exact same evidence you have that meta-verses exist beyond our universe: none. The choice is not between faith and evidence, it's between a paradox & coherence.

## Evolution is God's Chisel

Evolution is God's chisel and He chips away at those who failed to reproduce.

Like Michelangelo's David, if all humans who have ever existed are the stone block, those who have reproduced are the work of art that remains after God has carved humanity up to this point.

Natural Selection & Intelligent Design are two facets of the same truth, they are not in opposition.


## God Minimizes Faith

Having faith in God isn't about embracing faith, rather it's about minimizing it. God is the first & last thing that I need to have faith in, by having faith in God I don't need to place my faith in anything or anyone else.

Faith is a dangerous thing. Having faith in a misguided leader, in a corrupt institution, in almost anything, is dangerous & bad. But faith is not something that can be eliminated entirely, rather it's like indestructible, radioactive waste: it must be very carefully segregated & stored and any leaks must be treated with utmost severity.

God is the one & only safe place for us to put our faith. If I have faith in a perfect God, then our universe must be coherent & consistent and this is the foundation that all of science can be built upon.

If you don't believe that the Universe is coherent & consistent, then either the scientific pursuit doesn't make any sense or it's foundation is made of radioactive sand.

Many who #BelieveScience place their faith in our human leaders and human institutions. This is a dangerous error. Only God is perfect, any institutions that requires faith in present or future human perfection deserves to fall. That which can be destroyed by the truth, deserves to be.

## We Are Punished By Our Sins

We are punished by our sins, not for them.

There is no final judgement after we die. Instead, we are being judged by God every second of every day and our life is full of joy and/or suffering in proportion to how virtuously and/or sinfully we live our life.

The lonely 50 year old man with a long history of drug & porn addiction has crafted his very own Hell right here on Earth. On his death bed, as his life flashes before his eyes, he will suffer for one moment (aka eternity) as he reflects on the life he could have had, the beauty he could have created, the good deeds he could have done but didn't.

My grandpa passed away recently and, as he died peacefully in the arms of his loving wife, I suspect that his life flashed before his eyes and he experienced an eternity of Heaven as he reflected on the beauty of his community & family & all the positive contributions that he made to this wonderful world of ours.

Either way, once you die, you die and your story is over. Your song has ended.

There is no afterlife, there is no do-over, this life you have is your one & only shot. Don't blow it.

# A New Theism

I believe in God.

I do not, however, regularly visit any Christian Churches or Hindu Temples. I do see Christians & Hindus as being my allies in today's cultural cold war, my generation's dharamyudh, but for the most part I see traditional religions as being badly outdated & outgunned. Christianity in it's present form is no match for progressive atheism, traditional theism must die & be reborn as something better, stronger, and truer if Good wants to have a fighting chance against Evil.

I was raised amongst Christians & I spent ~3 years living in India amongst Hindus. Superficially, these two religions appear quite different but where they align, that's where the purest truths are most likely to be found. My worldview is still a work in progress, it will always be a work in progress, but as I gained exposure to a diverse array of worldviews, several very fundamental aspects of my own worldview have started to cool, harden, and crystallize.

Reader beware: when truth & lies come together the lies are not only destroyed, they are revealed to have never been in the first place. If you like being an atheist and would prefer to remain one, I recommend you close this article now. If, on the other hand, you are an atheist with unshakable faith or if you are open-minded enough that the idea of believing in God doesn't horrify you, proceed with caution.

I present several theistic idea-crystals below. If any of them can be destroyed by the truth, they deserve to be destroyed by the truth and I'd appreciate any help you can provide in helping to destroy them.

## God is Infinite & Perfect

We humans are "like" God except that we are finite and imperfect.

The Hindu Brahman is probably a better fit for what I'm calling God here. The Christian notion of God includes men & ghosts, neither of which have anything to do with the Great Beholder.

## The Universe is the mind of God

This realization cleanly assigns responsibilities for science & theology: Science is the study of our universe, theology is the study of everything beyond our universe. There can therefore be no conflict between theology & science unless one of these two is grossly misrepresented.

"Science is to psychology as Theology is to neuroscience" but from the viewpoint of a psychological construct who exists on a different plane of existence than the physical brain that's dreaming them up.

A man wondering "What is the nature of God?" is analogous to me dreaming up a pink elephant in my mind's eye who is wondering "What is the nature of this brain that created me?"

The atheist answer to "What contains our universe?" is some variation on "It's turtles all the way down" except usually with meta-verses or tiny strings or something instead of turtles. No, it's not turtles or strings or anything all the way down. There is a floor and that floor is God.

"But what evidence do you have that God exists?!" The exact same evidence you have that meta-verses exist beyond our universe: none. The only difference is that putting a floor on the "turtles all the way down" paradox makes it a more consistent & coherent worldview. The choice is not between faith and evidence, it's between a paradox & a coherent worldview.

## Natural Selection is God's Chisel

Natural selection is God's chisel and he chips away at those who failed to reproduce.

Like Michelangelo's David, if all humans who have ever existed are the stone block, those who have reproduced are what remains after God has carved humanity up to this point. Natural selection & Intelligent Design are two facets of the same truth, they are not in opposition.

## God minimizes faith

Faith is a dangerous thing. Having faith in a misguided leader, in a corrupt institution, is just about anything really, is dangerous & bad. But faith is not something that can be eliminated entirely, rather it's like radioactive waste that cannot be destroyed, it must be very carefully segregated & stored and any leaks must be treated with utmost severity.

God acts as the one & only safe place for us to put our faith. If I have faith in a perfect God, then our universe must be coherent & consistent and this is the foundation that all the rest of science can be built upon. If you don't believe that the Universe is coherent & consistent then either the scientific pursuit doesn't make any sense or it's foundation is made of radioactive sand like faith in an infinite stack of meta-verses.

Having faith in God isn't about embracing faith, rather it's about minimizing it. God is the first & last thing that I need to have faith in, by having faith in God I don't need to place my faith in anything else.

Many who simply "embrace science" are placing their faith in our human leaders and human institutions, this is an error. Only God is perfect, any institutions that requires faith in human perfection deserves to fall. That which can be destroyed by the truth, deserves to be.

## We are Punished by our sins, not for them

The lonely 40 year old man with a long history of porn addiction has crafted his own Hell right here on Earth, no faith in an afterlife is required (no faith in anything other than God is required). On his death bed, as his life flashes before his eyes, he will suffer for eternity (eternity meaning timeless or outside of time, not forever as in suffering for many many years).

My grandpa passed away recently and I believe that, as he died peacefully in the arms of his loving wife, his life flashed before his eyes and he experienced an eternity of Heaven as he reflected on the beauty of his community & family & all the positive contributions that he made to this wonderful world of ours.

There is no afterlife, there is no do-over, this life you have is your one & only shot so don't blow it.

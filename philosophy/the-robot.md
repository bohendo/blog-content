### aka The Singularity
### aka When Moloch finishes eating the world

It's the year 2120.

Several forces were coming to a head a century ago but they didn't have the language to describe it back them. Some called it Moloch, the god of coordination failure, but he's only part of the puzzle. Moloch is the landscape, the gradient that guided our progress but focusing on Moloch along means we miss what's happening upon the gradient.

And what was happening was that we were building The Robot :robot:. Not "A" robot, The Robot. The last thing we ever needed to build.

By now, we have long since surrendered to Moloch and, in doing so, defeated him.

Human progress is not exponential. It was never going to accelerate forever without limit, it's obviously not true now and we have trouble understanding how anyone thought it was true even 100 years ago. It's logistic, as S-shaped sigmoid curve: The rate of progress increased until a mid-point where the rate fell until eventually progress flattened out again. We're not exactly done and will likely never be done but we're well into the flat section of the progress curve now.

The rate of progress hit it's peak about 100 years ago and around 2020 the rate started falling. Looking back, we didn't realize how dangerous this transition would be going into it & I'm glad we didn't nuke ourselves back to the stone age before we could finish building The Robot.

Here's a hard truth, widely accepted now but it was a bitter pill to swallow the first time it was encountered: Humans are useless. We haven't always been useless of course, but today, there is nothing I can do for you that The Robot couldn't provide better, faster, and cheaper.  

Nothing.

Not just me but anyone. There is nothing that anybody can do for anyone today that The Robot can't do better.

Money still exists of course, money isn't going anywhere no matter how far ahead we look. But people don't pay other people for anything these days. 99.999% of all money exchanging hands is between people and The Robot. The little bit of money that does travel directly from human to human is done so in a recreational way. The same way some people still drive cars for fun on closed tracks even though The Robot controls all cars on all public roads.


## Misc

Some people are more useful than others right now.

It's a deep human trait that people who are more useful feel superior to those who are less useful.

But this is silly, because eventually everyone will be equally useless.

bc The Robot will control everything. The transition from useful people ruling the useless people to everyone being equally useless (aka we're done building The Robot) will occur and at that point, a snapshot of who owns what will decide the starting point for phase 2.

Once The Robot is done being built, no value will be transacted between people anymore, only between people and The Robot.

## UBI is inevitable

The Robot won't stabilize until it has a UBI system built in.

Final stages of Robot development, people will be giving money to The Robot w/out getting anything in return.. Until UBI. The people who started with less will steadily die off until eventually a system is set up to transfer value from the people who started w more to the people 

The Robot has a set of parameters that get tuned over time, stakeholders will vote on these parameters until they either settle on stable values or are replaced by a set of parameters that depend on other parameters or input.

Central gov taxes and private profit margins will merge into the same one parameter that we collectively set (or create an algorithm which sets it depending on eg population).

Example Parameters:
 - How much tax/profit to collect from transactions.
 - What percentage of tax goes to making food vs making houses
 - 

## Global Rules

Evolve from legal system

They'll start simple (eg don't kill anyone) and be made more & more complex (eg don't kill anyone unless they're trying to kill someone else) over time.

## Bonding curves

eg everyone wants a Lamborghini but there's only so much iron, available iron will be on a curve bonding curve that goes to infinity based on how much

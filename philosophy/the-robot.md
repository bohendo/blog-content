# The Robot :robot:

## aka The Singularity

The :robot: can only be built if we don't blow ourselves up with nukes.

Some people are more useful than others right now.

It's a deep human trait that people who are more useful feel superior to those who are less useful.

But this is silly, because eventually everyone will be equally useless.

bc The Robot will control everything. The transition from useful people ruling the useless people to everyone being equally useless (aka we're done building The Robot) will occur and at that point, a snapshot of who owns what will decide the starting point for phase 2.

Once The Robot is done being built, no value will be transacted between people anymore, only between people and The Robot.

## UBI is inevitable

The Robot won't stabilize until it has a UBI system built in.

Final stages of Robot development, people will be giving money to The Robot w/out getting anything in return.. Until UBI. The people who started with less will steadily die off until eventually a system is set up to transfer value from the people who started w more to the people 

The Robot has a set of parameters that get tuned over time, stakeholders will vote on these parameters until they either settle on stable values or are replaced by a set of parameters that depend on other parameters or input.

Central gov taxes and private profit margins will merge into the same one parameter that we collectively set (or create an algorithm which sets it depending on eg population).

Example Parameters:
 - How much tax/profit to collect from transactions.
 - What percentage of tax goes to making food vs making houses
 - 

## Global Rules

Evolve from legal system

They'll start simple (eg don't kill anyone) and be made more & more complex (eg don't kill anyone unless they're trying to kill someone else) over time.

## Bonding curves

eg everyone wants a Lamborghini but there's only so much iron, available iron will be on a curve bonding curve that goes to infinity based on how much

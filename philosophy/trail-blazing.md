### A metaphor for building things that have never been built before.

You're high in the mountains with a small team of friends. You're standing on point A and looking forward into the Haze of the Unknown. You have good reason to believe that there is a lush and beautiful Point B out there somewhere but the Haze is too thick to see much farther than your immediate surrounding.

You turn around & look behind you at the Known: a network of roads over mountain passes & settlements on plateaus which have already been thoroughly mapped out & developed. There are still small patches of Haze here & there but all of the major mountains & plains & paths between them have been discovered.

You can see two large settlements in front of you. The village on your left looks a bit older & less developed while the one to your right is quite a bit newer, larger, with a lot more activity. It makes sense, the village on the right is on a massive & beautifully flat plateau while the one of the left is in a valley; apparently being squashed by the mountains on either side.

There are two paths connecting these two villages, one is a wide & well developed highway while the other is old, skinny, and barely visible from where you're standing. You've heard the stories: the skinny road was established by the very first settler, piercing into the Haze of the Unknown of 50 years ago. As those settlers searched for a path to a better place to settle they searched their immediate surroundings & found that this high mountain pass was significantly easier to cross than the snow-capped mountain peaks to either side. It wasn't until later, as the rest of the mountain range was being explored, that the lower pass was discovered. As soon as this lower pass was discovered, all road-building investments switched to it and before long it was far wider & smoother than the now-abandoned high-pass-path would ever be.

You turn back around to face the Haze of the Unknown & remind yourself of your goal: Establish a settlement on the fabled Point B paradise.

Major phases of the journey:
 1. The POC: Find a path to Point B
 2. The MVP: Build out the path so that supply trucks can travel to Point B
 3. The Rest of it: With supplies from this new road, develop Point B into a thriving metropolis

## Phase 1: The POC. Find a path to Point B

You & your team set out on mostly random walks to dispel the Haze of the Unknown & to start looking for good paths that are pointing in the right direction. Pretty quickly you find a smooth & flat stretch of land that's pointing straight towards where Point B is supposed to be. You put down some quick & dirty road markers & remove a few obstruction to make travel along this path a bit easier.

You're careful not to invest too much resources into developing this path into a proper road yet. You can't see super far ahead and there's always a risk that you'll bump into an impossibly high mountain range with no nearby passes. In that case, you'll have to abandon this path in favor of one that's closer to a mountain pass & any investments into this road will be sunk.

You come to a spot where you could fork off in a couple different directions. So far, the path you've taken has been not only perfect.. But is the only obvious option. You resolve to invest a little bit into this first stretch of the path to make subsequent searching a little smoother. Beyond this fork, you resolve to invest as little as possible since it's unclear which way you should be going.

### The Crux

You pick a branch of the fork & move forward. The path you chose looks super promising for a long time but, soon enough, the Haze of the Unknown clears before you to reveal a massive mountain range before you. You wander a bit right & left but no obvious mountain passes are visible. You're looking for a pass that would be capable of being built up into a major road someday if the path you're on really is the best way to get to point B.

This mountain pass is tall & wide enough that it would probably be the crux of the journey: the single most difficult part to pass. If you can pass the crux, you can pass anything else on this path.

But you're still surrounded by the Haze of the Unknown. You can't tell whether there are even higher mountains after this, or whether this mountain range is too tall to cross & you'll need to take a different route with a different crux.

### The Hacky Fix

You notice what looks like a way to pass atop a small cliff that's knobby & looks like it'd be pretty easy to climb. There would be no way to pave a road over this spot so no path that includes this pass would fulfil the POC requirements. But you would be able to skip past it to find out, **if** you invested the time into finding a good pass over this mountain range, would this path otherwise be a good way to get to Point B?

You & your team mark this spot on your map with a `// TODO`, scamper up this cliff, and move pass this range to explore the landscape beyond.

You follow the path and, much to your delight, Point B emerges before you. You have arrived at your destination.

### Beware Premature Optimization

You recognize this point in your journey as being an unexpectedly dangerous one: your team is celebrating as if phase 1 is over & has already started discussing the specifics of how to build the path you've followed so far into a major road.

You've heard the horror stories: expeditions who found a path with one hacky pass over a mountain range and were overconfident that they could either find a different pass or dynamite their way through the one they found. Expeditions are always under time pressure so it's common for them to start building out roads before the path is finalized. One team took this too far & built out beautiful roads on either side of their path's crux. When it came time to pave their highest mountain pass, they discovered that their hacky pass was the only one remotely close to the roads they've already built & that this hacky path would require an impossible amount of dynamite to brute-force their way through. When their situation became clear, they tried to shift some roads towards using another pass but they had too few resources left & that expedition failed.

You don't want your expedition to follow the same path so you remind your team that Phase 1 isn't over yet. We can't start talking about building up this path until we're sure that this path really can get supply trucks to Point B.

You return the way to came until you encounter the pass that you hacked your way over last time. Now that you know this pass is the only thing stopping you from achieving the POC, you go full force mapping out the range on either side. More quickly than you expected, you find a much more reasonable pass that could be turned into a major highway given significant investment. It's not ideal but it fulfils your requirements.

You have now found an acceptable route from Point A to Point B. You have achieved the POC milestone.

## Phase 2: The MVP. Build the road to Point B.

You already got a head start with the first stretch of this path. Getting a head start is risky since, until Phase 1 is complete, you can't *really* know which paths are worth turning into supply-truck-worthy roads. But small head starts here & there generally have a positive ROI.

Your teammates get to work building out the road on either side of the crux while you turn your focus to the crux itself. 

The acceptable pass you found could be turned into a road with a fair bit of dynamite. You debate investing in this dynamite now vs taking a little more time to search for an easier path.. You didn't search very deeply in phase 1 because you found an acceptable path so quickly, but now that it's time to invest in turning this acceptable path into a real road, it's time to consider searching a little more.

The expected value of searching a little longer is high so you probe a bit more. Luckily enough, you discover a much smoother, lower pass to cross this mountain range. You scrap earlier plans & devote all your crux resources to this newly discovered mountain pass.

### Feature Creep

With the crux well-paved and the rest of the roads coming along nicely, you find yourself discussing phase 3 with your team.

One teammate mentions that they found an ore-rich place to mine just a little off the path past the crux. They're talking about how, since the road-builders are out there already, they'll connect their road to the ore mine while they're at it.

You remind them: the next milestone towards a thriving metropolis at Point B is the first new resident arriving. Connecting the ore mine might be valuable for the long-term prosperity of Point B but it won't get the first resident there any sooner. You all resolve to focus entirely on getting the first resident to Point B as quickly as possible.

### Beware Premature Deployment

Your team starts talking about people they know who might want to be one of the first residents at Point B. Discussion turns towards the rough patches of the route that haven't been paved yet & ways that we can manually help these residents over the rough spots so that we can hit the "first residents" milestone as soon as possible.

You recognize this discussion as dangerously similar to the one that doomed a previous expedition. This failed expedition successfully passed Phase 1 but they started bringing residents in before they completed phase 2. With some parts of the road unpaved, arriving residents required manual help from the expedition team. This team poured their heart & soul into assisting these new residents & helping make their moving experience as pleasant as possible. They stopped investing in their roads & left them half-finished. With new residents arriving every day, they didn't want to close the road to finishing building it. And the more time they spent helping residents, the less time they had to invest into the road anyway.

Residents following this expedition grew dissatisfied. Supplies took too long to arrive, half of the expedition team was dedicated to helping supply trucks navigate the half-paved roads but it wasn't enough: too many supplies were required. The other half of the team was dedicated to guiding residents to/from their settlement but, again, there were too many residents wanting to travel between points A and B and not enough expedition members available to guide them. Eventually, one prestigious resident got frustrated & left for good. It didn't take long for the rest to follow.

Once all the residents left, the expedition team was able to finish building their roads but, by then, the reputation hit was too great & their settlement eventually died off.

### The first resident

You resolve not to repeat the mistakes of the previous expedition so you remind your team that phase 2 isn't complete until all the roads are well enough paved. You ignore the ore mines and hold off on advertising to any potential residents while laser-focusing on paving the roads.

You're on a tight time crunch & running low on funds so you do decide to hurry things along by bringing one single resident in before the roads are 100% paved.

Once your roads are 95% paved, your whole team takes a break & focuses on helping the first resident through. This first resident glided right over some unpaved road that you were worried about, and got stuck on another patch of road that you thought was finished. With this first resident's feedback, you take a break from helping residents & focus on paving again. You fix the parts that the first resident got stuck on & de-prioritize the unpaved road that's still smooth enough.

Once major feedback has been addressed, you invite your second resident. This resident has a much smoother time, with only a couple minor snags. You fix these and then invite your third resident who manages to travel from point A to point B without any input from the expedition team at all.

This marks the end of Phase 2

## Phase 3: Build Point B into a Metropolis

The hard part's over.

Now that residents can travel from point A to point B without significant help, you ease into accepting more residents. More rough patches continued to surface as the number of residents increases and you prioritize resolving them as they popped up. The more often residents are able to make the journey without help, the more residents you allow until you have a steady stream of residents proceeding from point A to point B mostly on their own.

Now, you have resources to put towards building Point B up beyond just a minimum viable village. You connect your roads to the ore mine. You connect them to the hot springs & the nearby view points. 

As you make Point B more appealing, more & more residents move in until your new settlement's growth becomes self-sustaining. Residents themselves are becoming more knowledgeable about the route & some are even starting to expand it completely on their own. They're batting away the Haze of the Unknown surrounding your village until the area will well mapped out & developed.

One day, you're on your balcony overlooking the village you helped create. Up in the hill above, something catches your eye. You see a small group of adventurous-looking youngsters surveying the Point B Village from the very edge of what's been mapped out. They're swapping rumors about a fabled Point C: far more lush & beautiful than any other village.

You watch them turn around, face the haze of the unknown, and set forth.

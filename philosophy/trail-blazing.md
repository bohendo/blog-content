### A metaphor for building things that have never been built before.

The two distinct phases of a [slow-motion lightning strike](http://gifb.in/mFsV) mirror the POC/path-finding and MVP/path-widening phases of this story.

You're high in the mountains with a small team of adventurous friends. You're standing on a grassy hill above a village called Point A, behind you is the thick darkness of the haze of the unknown. You and your friends are swapping stories about a lush and beautiful place called Point B that's rumored to be out there somewhere. The haze of the unknown is too thick to see very far & know for certain, but you have good reason to believe that the rumors are true.

You take a moment to survey the surroundings of Point A. You can see a network of roads over mountain passes & settlements on plateaus. The territory surrounding Point A has been well mapped out, there are still a few small patches of Haze here & there but all of the biggest mountains & plains & paths between them have been discovered.

You can see another settlement, much further out in the distance. This is one of the older settlements, it's been around since long before you were born.

There is only one major road connecting the far village to Point A but you can see another road extending from the far village towards Point A & a road extending from Point A towards the far village. Right in the middle, sits some massively tall mountains which are completely impassible. The failed Expedition X build these disconnected roads. At first glance, you'd think that Expedition X was a bunch of crazy people to build such a beautiful road up to the base of an impassible mountain range. But at the time they were building, the mountain pass was still hidden by Haze of the Unknown.

You can see the ruins of a third village further off in the distance, this one was built by failed Expedition Z. You can clearly see a narrow path connecting the far village to this one: hardly a mountain between them, certainly no impassible mountain ranges. But the road that does exist is narrow and crumbling. Nothing like the super highway connecting the far village to Point A.

You discuss these failed expeditions with your friends & vow not to make the same mistakes as they did. After a bit of final discussion, you turn back around to face the Haze of the Unknown & remind yourself of your goal: Establish a settlement on the fabled Point B paradise.

Major phases of the journey ahead:
 1. The POC: Find a path to Point B
 2. The MVP: Build out the path so that new residents can travel to Point B unassisted
 3. The Rest: With supplies from this new road, develop Point B into a thriving metropolis

## Phase 1: The POC. Find a path to Point B

You & your team set out on a mostly random walk to dispel the Haze of the Unknown & to start looking for good paths that are pointing in the right direction. Pretty quickly you find a smooth & flat stretch of land that's pointing straight towards where Point B is supposed to be. You put down some quick & dirty road markers & remove a few obstruction to make travel along this path a bit easier.

You're careful not to invest too much resources into developing this path into a proper road yet. You can't see very far ahead through the haze so there's always a risk that you'll bump into an impossibly high mountain range with no nearby passes. In that case, you'll have to abandon this path in favor of one that's closer to a mountain pass & any investments into this road will be sunk.

You come to a spot where you could fork off in a couple different directions. You explore a couple of them but turn back when they appear to be unpromising. Eventually you chose a path that turns to point in the exact right direction.

### The Crux

You move forward excitedly. This path appears to be a straight shot towards Point B until a massive mountain range emerges from the haze of the unknown in front of you. You follow the mountain range a little bit right & left but no obvious mountain passes are visible. You're looking for a pass that would be capable of being built up into a major road someday if this path really is the best way to get to point B.

This mountain pass is tall & wide enough that it looks like it will be the crux of the journey: the single most difficult part to pass. If you can pass the crux, you can pass anything else along that path.

But you're still surrounded by the Haze of the Unknown. You can't tell whether there are even higher mountains after this, or whether this mountain range is too tall to cross & you'll need to take a different route with a different crux.

You recognize this part of the journey as one that will require quite a bit of time to traverse, but you're still in phase 1 so you don't want to expend a huge amount of energy before you know that there won't be a show stopper right on the other side.

### The Hacky Fix

You notice what looks like a way to climb over these mountains atop a small cliff that's knobby & looks like it'd be pretty easy to climb. There would be no way to pave a road over this slip so no path that includes this shortcut would fulfil the POC requirements. But you would be able to skip past it to find out, **if** you invested the time into finding a good pass over this mountain range, would this path be a good way to get to Point B?

You & your team mark this spot on your map with a `// TODO`, scamper up this cliff, and move pass this range to explore the landscape beyond.

You follow the path and, much to your delight, Point B emerges before you. You have arrived at your destination.

### Beware Premature Optimization

You recognize this point in your journey as being an unexpectedly dangerous one: your team is celebrating as if phase 1 is over & has already started discussing the specifics of how to build the path you've followed so far into a major road.

This is exactly the trap that Expedition X fell into. They found an easy shortcut over a difficult patch and arrogantly assumed that there would be many other possible paths within the haze of the unknown. They started investing heavily in the roads on either side of this crux while they searched for a better path. But the more haze they swept aside, the more impenetrable this mountain range appeared. By the time they mapped enough of the mountain range to understand that it was not feasible to build a road across, they had already sunk too many resources into their roads. They did not have enough funding leftover to re-route so that expedition failed & gave up.

Another expedition came along later & found that a completely different path avoided this mountain range entirely, and this route was later built up into a super highway connecting the far village to Point A.

You don't want your expedition to follow the same path ax Expedition X's so you remind your team that Phase 1 isn't over yet. We can't start talking about investing in our current path until we're sure that it really can get support a road between Points A and Point B.

You return the way to came until you encounter the pass that you hacked your way over last time. Now that you know this pass is the only thing stopping you from achieving the POC, you go full force mapping out the range on either side. More quickly than you expected, you find a much more reasonable pass that could be turned into a major highway given significant investment. It's not ideal but it fulfils your requirements.

You have now found an acceptable route from Point A to Point B. You have achieved the POC milestone & Phase 1 is over.

## Phase 2: The MVP. Build the road to Point B.

Your teammates get to work building out the road on either side of the crux while you turn your focus to the crux itself. 

The acceptable pass you found could be turned into a road with a fair bit of dynamite. You debate buying a bunch of dynamite now vs taking a little more time to search for an easier path.. You didn't search very deeply in phase 1 because you found an acceptable path relatively quickly, but now that it's time to invest in turning this acceptable path into a real road, it's time to consider searching a little more.

The expected value of searching more outweighs that of a bunch of dynamite so you continue probing. Before too long, you discover a much smoother, lower pass to cross this mountain range. You scrap earlier plans & devote all resources to developing this newly discovered mountain pass. With all the money you expected to spend on dynamite, you manage to get the crux paved in half-time with some left over. Lucky you.

### Feature Creep

With the crux taken care of and the rest of the roads coming along nicely, you find yourself discussing phase 3 with your team.

One teammate mentions that they found a beautiful hot spring just a little off the path before Point B. They're talking about how, since the road-builders are out there already, they want to just go ahead & connect point B to this excursion.

You remind your team that a hot spring connected to the Point B Village is not useful until the road to Point B is passable. You all decide to focus exclusively on the happy path until it's possible for new residents to make it out to Point B.

### Premature Outreach

The conversation turns to ways that we can manually help new residents over the rough patches on our half-paved road. With a little manual guidance, we could start bringing residents in almost immediately. The team discusses this possibility excitedly until you recognize this topic as the one that doomed Expedition Z.

Expedition Z successfully found an acceptable path to their new settlement but they started bringing residents in before the road was finished being paved. With some parts of the road unpaved, arriving residents required manual help from the expedition team. The Expedition Z team poured their heart & soul into assisting these new residents & did everything they could to make their moving experience as pleasant as possible. With new residents arriving every day, they couldn't close the roads to finishing building them, not that they had any resources to spare. And the more time they spent helping residents, the less time they had to invest into the road anyway.

Residents following this expedition grew dissatisfied. Supplies took too long to arrive, half of the expedition team was dedicated to helping supply trucks navigate the half-paved roads but it wasn't enough: too many supplies were required to support their residents. The other half of the team was dedicated to guiding residents to/from their settlement but, again, there were too many residents wanting to travel between points A and B and not enough expedition members available to guide them. Eventually, one prestigious resident got frustrated & left for good. It didn't take long for the rest to follow.

Once all the residents left, the expedition team was able to finish building their roads but, by then, the reputation hit was too great & their settlement eventually died off.

### The first resident

You resolve not to repeat the mistakes of Expedition Z so you remind your team that phase 2 isn't complete until all the roads are well enough paved for residents to commute without any help. You delay sending an open invitation to new residents & laser-focus on paving the roads instead.

You're on a tight time crunch & running low on funds so, once your roads are 95% paved, you decide to hurry things along by bringing one single resident in. Your whole team focuses all of their attention on observing & helping this first resident on their journey to Point B. This first resident glided right over some unpaved road that you were worried about, and got stuck on another patch of road that you thought was finished.

Once this first resident is through, you & your team get to work fixing the parts that the first resident got stuck on while de-prioritizing the unpaved road that was smooth enough to not cause any problems.

Once feedback from this first resident has been complete addressed, you invite your second resident. This resident has a much smoother time, with only a couple minor snags. You fix these and then invite your third resident who manages to travel from point A to point B without any input from the expedition team at all.

This marks the end of Phase 2: You have built a road from Point A to Point B that residents can travel across without needing any help.

## Phase 3: Build Point B into a Metropolis

The hard part's over.

Now that residents can travel from point A to point B without significant help, you ease into accepting more residents. More rough patches continue to surface as the number of residents increases and you prioritize resolving them as they popped up. The more often residents are able to make the journey without help, the more residents you allow until you have a steady stream of residents proceeding from point A to point B mostly on their own.

Now, you have resources to put towards building Point B up beyond just a minimum viable village. You connect your roads to the nearby hot spring & ore mines.

As you make Point B more appealing, more & more residents move in until your new settlement's growth becomes self-sustaining. Residents themselves are becoming more knowledgeable about the route & some are even starting to expand it completely on their own. They're batting away the Haze of the Unknown surrounding your village until the area is almost entirely mapped out, with just a few tiny patches of haze remaining.

One day, you're on your balcony overlooking the bustling village of Point B. Up in the hill above, something catches your eye. You see a small group of adventurous-looking friends surveying the Point B Village from the very edge of the map. They're swapping rumors about a fabled Point C: far more lush & beautiful than any other village known to man.

You watch them turn around, face the haze of the unknown, and set forth.

The End.

## Morals of the story

While building something that has never been built before, there are distinct phases:

 1. Build a POC (aka Blaze a trail through the haze of the unknown)
 2. Build an MVP (aka Harden your happy path until users can follow it unassisted at volume)
 3. Build up your user base (aka get as many people on your trail as you can & expand your trail to include additional features beyond the core happy-path)

### It is dangerous to move on to the next phase before your current phase is complete.

If you try to start upgrading your POC towards becoming an MVP before the concept has really been proven, then you risk wasting a bunch of resources hardening paths that you don't need. The more resources you spend on unnecessary paths, the fewer resources you have to put towards finding out which paths you actually need.

Modifying the path's route can be a healthy part of phase 2, but only in the context of switching from an acceptable path to a better one. If no acceptable path exists yet, then phase 2 hasn't actually started.

Bringing users in to test your POC before it's a real MVP can be a healthy part of phase 2, but only in the context of accumulating data that will be used to influence further development towards the MVP. Each user should get an unsustainable amount of attention & support, the goal w these users is not to make money or grow the community, but to collect data & optimize the user experience towards requiring as few resources from the core team as possible.

If you try to start recruiting users in bulk before your MVP is actually viable, then you risk wasting a bunch of resources assisting users who will eventually grow dissatisfied & leave. The more resources you spend managing a large community of users, the fewer resources you have to put towards making your minimal product truly viable.

Continuing to harden the main happy path is a healthy part of phase 3, but only in the context of polishing off the rough spots. If users cannot reliably travel the main happy path without someone holding their hand, then phase 3 hasn't actually started yet.

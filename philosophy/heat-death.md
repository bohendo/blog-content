# The Heat Death of the Universe

There is no forever.

Heat death, an example:

I light a fire in a box & then *completely* seal it off forever. What happens?

The fire will burn for a while, turning fuel + oxygen into carbon dioxide + water + heat. The rising hot air creates air currents that scatter ash throughout the box. The fire lights up the box & this swirling ash casts shadows on the walls.

This is the climax, the most exciting part. This is maximum free-energy flow.

After an hour, either the fuel or oxygen runs low & the fire dies out. Hot glowing embers still emit a deep red glow but, over time, this fades too until the box is completely dark. Over the following days, cool air steadily saps heat from the embers until the air & embers & ash & everything in the box is the same temperature (a few degrees warmer than it started). Without a temperature gradient, airflow completely fades and even the lightest finest dust settles out of the air.

Thermal equilibrium has been achieved & free-energy is no longer flowing. Nothing in this box will ever move again. This box is heat-dead.

Notice I'm talking about free-energy being depleted, not just energy. The total amount of energy contained within this box is the exact same before and after reaching equilibrium. What's changed is how much free-energy is available to do useful work vs how much has been lost to entropy.

The 2nd law of Thermodynamics: Entropy always increases aka free-energy always decreases aka heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one.

This is the most ironclad law of physics, you cannot break the 2nd law of thermodynamics no matter what.

-----

We are that fire and the universe is the box.

The fire cannot burn forever.

Me and you and everyone we know is going to die someday no matter what.

Even if we discover the elixir of life tomorrow and then upload our consciousness into the cloud the day after, every single soul is going to fizzle out someday as surely as that fire will.

The heat death of the universe is coming and nothing can stop it.

This doesn't need to be a sad thing, it's nothing to get depressed about. This doesn't mean that nothing matters or that us dancing through the free energy flow isn't beautiful.

That the song will end doesn't make it any less beautiful.

> I'll tell you a secret. Something they don't teach you in your temple. The Gods envy us. They envy us because we're mortal, because any moment might be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we're doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now. We will never be here again. â€• David Benioff

## Summary of above

We should have encountered some trace of alien life by now, given:
 - How many stars there are out there
 - How quickly we've progressed

Are we just super special? Probably not.

## Cosmic Rays

AKA random particles flying around at relativistic speeds (aka measured in % of speed of light instead of mph)

They come from supernova, stars colliding, stuff that sling-shots off blackholes, etc

We on earth don't care about these bc we have a magnetic field & an atmosphere that protects us. But those doesn't exist in interstellar space.

We have astronauts who hang out in space for months w/out an issue, what's the big deal?

Cosmic rays aren't an acute problem but a chronic one.

Eg Proxima Centauri is just a few light years away but modern rockets would take many thousands of years to make the trip (or futuristic nuclear pulse propulsion rockets might be able to make the trip in ~1000 years.

I don't think transporting info across these vast distances will ever make economic sense, whether that's biological info in DNA or electronic info in a hard drive. Cosmic rays will degrade info of any form without some extremely expensive shielding.

We haven't

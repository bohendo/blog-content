# What is True?

- The sky is blue
- I am
- 12 + 1 = 13
- entropy always increases
- the price of 1 ounce of gold was $1824.65 on Feb 14th, 2021 at 17:00 UTC
- Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election

Which of the above statements are true?

We could claim that all of them are true, but some seem more true than others. Or, at least, some are true in different contexts than others.

Philosophical trouble arises when we try to boil Truth down to just one thing in one context, any progress in that direction generally requires gesturing vaguely at a higher power or levels of abstraction far removed from anything useful. Instead, I'm ditching the quest for a unified theory of truth and am perfectly content describing the truth as applying to one of two distinct contexts:

- Subjective reality
- Objective reality

In the header image, subjective reality is represented by blood-red: the color of life, the color of that which fuels & nourishes all of humankind including my brain and, therefore, my subjective reality (assuming my worldview is correct). Meanwhile, objective reality is represented by a metallic gray, the color of stone & metal & machines & all those things which are cold & unyielding.

### Subjective Reality

My subjective truths are true within my subjective experience my conscious reality.

It is subjectively true that I believe the sky is blue.
It is subjectively true that I am a little bit hungry.
It is subjectively true that I can hear Get Free by Lana Del Rey playing in the background.

"I am" stands out as being subjectively true for everyone capable of comprehending the statement, almost by definition.

An individual's subjective truths are the lowest-level, most fundamental truths that can possibly exist.

There are some fun movies like The Matrix or Inception which play games with the fabric of reality, but subjective truths remain deeply true even if the fabric of reality were to shift from under our feet.

If I feel hungry, it doesn't matter whether I'm plugged into the Matrix or not, I still feel hungry. Whether I'm lost in a dream or a brain in a vat, I can be utterly and unshakably certain in the truth that I really do in fact feel the sensation of hunger.

Within my consciousness, there exists concepts of "sky" and "blue" and these concepts fit together in a way that feels true to me. If you do not believe that the sky is blue, then that statement would be subjectively false for you.

Subjective truths are set in stone and are not open to negotiation. If I say "I do not believe the sky is blue", nobody can argue with this and say "well actually you do believe so and so". You are the one and only master of your subjective reality.

### Objective Reality

Objective truths are true if we can verify them in objective reality.

We could also refer to objective truths as "empirical truths" because they depend on going out into the real world and seeing for ourselves how things really are.

We could walk out of our house right now, look up at the sky and be somewhat certain in the objective truth of "the sky is blue" (or in the objective falsity of this statement if it happens to be stormy).

(I say "somewhat certain" because there are fundamental limits to what we can know about objective reality. We could be plugged into a simulation in which every possible experiment points to the conclusion that the sky is blue but maybe in a higher level reality the sky is on fire or something. But, for the rest of this essay we'll set aside the possibility that reality is fundamentally different than it appears.)

Entropy is a bit non-obvious but, if you manage to wrap your head around it & run experiments, you'll find that it's among the deepest objective truths that we know. And, objectively, the global increase in entropy will remain true no matter what I subjectively believe to be true.

Reality is that which, when subjectively false, is still objectively true.

2 + 2 = 4 *feels* like an objective truth, it's math after all and math is a subject adjacent to science which is entirely focused on understanding objective reality. But, if we wanted to go out into the world and verify this statement, what would we look for? We'd try to add up 2..? Of what, exactly?

Abstract math is, counter-intuitively, not contained in the realm of objective reality. 2 + 2 = 4 is a purely subjective truth that depends entirely on your concept of what "2" in the abstract means. If I ask you "what comes after 12?", the answer would be different if our context is an abstract number line vs non-military-time hours of the day.

## Truth Within Truth

Like yin-yang: within each aspect of reality, there contains a simulation of the other.

Within my subjective reality, there is a simulation of objective reality.
Within objective reality, there exists some notion of our communal subjective reality.


### Worldview

**The Objective Truth w/in Subjective Truth**

My subjective reality contains a simulation of objective reality. If I close my eyes and imagine holding a ball in my hand and simulate what will happen if I open my hand, I can predict that the ball will accelerate down towards the ground.

Your subjective reality is on an entirely different plane of existence than objective reality. If you open your hand and watch a ball start to fall, your perception of the world ie your worldview gets updated to include a ball that's speeding up towards the ground. You might perceive & process this information while deciding to take action, you might consider catching the ball or letting it fall. This consideration can only take into account info within your worldview, no information from objective reality can be considered until it's first imported into your worldview.

It is, in my opinion, a noble goal to cultivate a worldview that is as rich and accurate a portrayal of objective reality as possible. It's, obviously, a futile exercise to try to make it a perfect fit. There is no destination in the journey to sync up your worldview with objective reality, only a direction that you can travel in.

Having an accurate worldview is generally a valuable thing with no downsides, but there are edge cases where letting your worldview diverge from objective reality has utility.. For some definitions of utility, at least.

There are no hard & fast rules dictating your worldview, anything goes. If I want to imagine a bright purple sky with lime green clouds, I can.

### Consensus

**The Subjective Truth w/in Objective Truth**

**Aka the Human Hivemind's Subjective Truth**

Notice that I qualified the earlier discussion of subjective truth by specifying it as "my" subjective truth or "an individual's" subjective truth.

There is another sense in which we can talk about subjective truth, that is: a group's subjective truth. Or, more broadly, humanity's subjective truth. I'll call it THE subjective truth.

As this is an emergent property of many people's individual subjective truths, it is necessarily a subset of objective truth. Other people are not part of my subjective experience, they're a part of objective reality. And, just like other aspects of objective reality, there are fundamental limits to what I can possibly know about other people. At the lowest level, I might believe that another person is human just like me, but I could be plugged into the matrix & she is only a simulation of a person. Or maybe I'm on social media and she's simply a sock puppet controlled by a click farm in some other country.

The only things I can be 100% sure of w regards to other people is my own worldview of them and the actions they take. If I ask someone what color they think the sky is, I can make good guesses at their subjective reality but make no mistake: our subjective realities are on two different planes of reality. Each consciousness exists only in the other person's objective reality and, collectively, we comprise a higher-order subjective reality that is a part of everyone's objective reality.

## Truth Distortions

When people talk about "the truth", they're generally conflating our consensus and the objective truth within their worldview. Conflating these two things is, almost always, a great heuristic & a wise move.

It's objectively true (w/in my worldview) that the sky is generally blue and we humans have a consensus that they sky is generally blue. Mixing up these two contexts of truth rarely comes with any downsides. Rarely, not never.

Trouble can arise when subjective and objective truth diverge. For example: Chernobyl. The consensus was that the Soviet Union is a highly-capable nuclear superpower and they build reactors that cannot possibly explode. The objective truth is that a Soviet RBMK reactor exploded. Things got very bad at Chernobyl & they didn't get better until the consensus caved-in and accepted the cold, hard, unyielding objective reality.

If you stay zoomed out, it looks like there would be no benefit to consensus diverging from objective truth. There's massive risk and no systemic benefit. One might think we'd all be happily working together to bring our collective consensus as closely in line with objective reality as possible.

Unfortunately, when you zoom in & notice individual incentives, you'll find a multi-polar trap: each individual benefits at the group's expense if they treat the subjective reality of those in power as more important/relevant/correct than objective reality.

This means subjective & objective truth will diverge most commonly & most severely close to power. Not watts, political power like what CEOs and Kings have.

From another angle, it looks like power over people can be used to fend off objective reality. With enough power, you can live out your subjective truth as if it were the one & only truth there ever was. For a little while at least. Objective reality is that which is still true when it's subjectively false though, be careful not to trip over it.

In practice, most people are, most of the time, not powerful enough to cause noticeable truth distortions so most of us live our day-to-day lives in a world where subjective & objective reality are essentially one and the same.

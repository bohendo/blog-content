# What is True?

- I am
- 12 + 1 = 13
- The sky is blue
- A nugget of gold is more valuable than a bottle of water
- Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election

Which of the above statements are true?

We could claim that all of them are true, but some seem more true than others. Or, at least, some are true in different contexts. In fact, determining the context is the single most important part of deciding whether any of the above are true. Once the context is determined, the answer is often either obvious or nonsensical.

I think the quest for a unified theory of truth is Quixotic, I'm perfectly content cleaving the truth into two different contexts:
- Subjective reality
- Objective reality

### Subjective Reality

**aka The Realm of Chaos**

**aka Consciousness**

**aka The Mind of Man**

"I am" stands out as being subjectively true for everyone capable of comprehending the statement, almost by definition.

There are no rules in subjective reality. I can think "the sky is blue" one second and "the sky is lime green" the next, I can vividly imagine a bright green sky peaking out behind a fluffy pink cloud & bring this scene to life in my mind. I can take acid or magic mushrooms, look out the window, and *see with my own eyes* a bright green sky with fluffy pink clouds. Within my subjective reality, the sky can truly be green, even if it's blue and always has been/will be blue in objective reality.

The subjective color of the sky is, more specifically, as aspect of my worldview. My worldview is a reflection of objective reality so we could say that the color of the sky is more deeply true in objective reality than in subjective reality. But there are many things that are more deeply true in subjective reality than objective reality:

- Value Judgements: It is subjectively true that gold is more valuable than water.. Unless I'm dying of thirst in the desert, in which case water is more valuable. Maybe my gold nugget is worth all the money in New York City and the water bottle costs $0.50. If I'm dying of thirst, I don't care. My subjective value judgement is what's important, so I trade my gold for water.
- Sensations & sensory input: It is subjectively true that I can hear Get Free by Lana Del Rey playing in the background. Maybe I'm plugged into the matrix and my bluetooth speaker is actually an intricately rendered 3D model, this doesn't change the fact that I can hear the music & perceive it streaming into my subjective reality.
- Actions & muscle output: It is subjectively true that I'm wiggling my finger right now. Maybe I'm lost in a dream and sleeping peacefully. I can still be completely certain that I'm sending the signal even if the signal is getting intercepted before it reaches my finger.
- Morality: It is subjectively true that murdering innocent children is evil. Maybe I'll find myself in some twisted real-life trolley problem where killing one child saves 100 doctors but that doesn't change the fact that I believe very deeply in the evilness of murdering kids.
- Ends: Means towards an end are often dependent on objective reality, but deciding which ends to pursue in the first place is something that is rooted most deeply in subjective reality. Maybe I'm trying to support a non-profit that saves children from being murdered but I've been hoodwinked and I'm *actually* donating money to a company that sells kid burgers. Even if my actions are counter productive in objective reality, the ends I'm working towards exist in my subjective reality.

Remember, there are no rules in subjective reality. This is the realm of chaos. I can value sand over water for no good reason. I can perceive nonsense & fly in my dreams. I can rationalize why murdering kids is actually a noble thing to do and then still choose to commit self-perceived atrocities by saving the lives of a school bus full of children. **Subjective reality can be inconsistent.**

One source of inconsistency is that many aspects of subjective reality are hidden in a haze, out of sight of my conscious awareness. Much like a web browser running on my laptop's operating system, my consciousness is a [user space program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space) with very few permissions granted to control the underlying hardware. This is a good thing, it's for my own protection. For example, my subconscious is responsible for regulating my stress levels and my consciousness is, luckily, unable to affect this directly. Otherwise, I might accidentally give myself a heart attack by meditating the wrong way.

Jed says:
> I'm like Socrates; all I know is that I know nothing. That's like the subtext of the cogito, together they form the alpha and omega of all knowledge: I know that I Am, and I know that I know nothing else. That's an easy thing to say, but it's a helluva thing to know.


### Objective Reality

**aka The Realm of Order**

**aka The Universe**

**aka The Mind of God**

Objective reality plays out in a perfect, beautiful dance. **Objective reality is perfectly consistent.** Well, as far as We've been able to tell. The inside of black holes is still an open question.

We could also refer to objective truths as "empirical truths" because they depend on going out into the real world and seeing for ourselves how things really are.

I could walk out of my house right now, look up at the sky and be somewhat certain in the objective truth of "the sky is blue" (or maybe in the objective falsity of this statement if it's stormy).

I say "somewhat certain" because there are fundamental limits to what we can know about objective reality. We could be plugged into a simulation in which every possible experiment points to the conclusion that the sky is blue but maybe in some higher level reality the sky is on fire. Objective reality is the highest level of non-subjective reality.

Reality is that which, when subjectively false, is still objectively true.

2 + 2 = 4 *feels* like an objective truth, it's math after all and math is a subject adjacent to science which is entirely focused on understanding objective reality. But, if we wanted to go out into the world and verify this statement, what would we look for? We'd try to add up 2..? Of what, exactly?

Abstract math is, counter-intuitively, not contained in the realm of objective reality. 2 + 2 = 4 is a purely subjective truth that depends entirely on your concept of what "2" in the abstract means. If I ask you "what comes after 12?", the answer would be different if our context is an abstract number line vs non-military-time hours of the day.


## Truth Within Truth

Like yin-yang: within each aspect of reality, there contains a simulation of the other.

Within my subjective reality, there is a simulation of objective reality: my worldview.
Within objective reality, there exists some notion of our communal subjective reality: the consensus.


### Worldview

**The Objective Truth w/in Subjective Truth**

My subjective reality contains a simulation of objective reality. If I close my eyes and imagine holding a ball in my hand and simulate what will happen if I open my hand, I can predict that the ball will accelerate down towards the ground.

Your subjective reality is on an entirely different plane of existence than objective reality. If you open your hand and watch a ball start to fall, your perception of the world ie your worldview gets updated to include a ball that's speeding up towards the ground. You might perceive & process this information while deciding to take action, you might consider catching the ball or letting it fall. This consideration can only take into account info within your worldview, no information from objective reality can be considered until it's first imported into your worldview.

It is, in my opinion, a noble goal to cultivate a worldview that is as rich and accurate a portrayal of objective reality as possible. It's, obviously, a futile exercise to try to make it a perfect fit. There is no destination in the journey to sync up your worldview with objective reality, only a direction that you can travel in.

Having an accurate worldview is generally a valuable thing with no downsides, but there are edge cases where letting your worldview diverge from objective reality has utility.. For some definitions of utility, at least.

There are no hard & fast rules dictating your worldview, anything goes. If I want to imagine a bright purple sky with lime green clouds, I can.

### Society

**The Subjective Truth w/in Objective Truth**

**Aka The Human Hivemind's Subjective Truth**

**Aka The Consensus**

Notice that I qualified the earlier discussion of subjective truth by specifying it as "my" subjective truth or "an individual's" subjective truth.

There is another sense in which we can talk about subjective truth, that is: a group's subjective truth. Or, more broadly, humanity's subjective truth. I'll call it THE subjective truth.

As this is an emergent property of many people's individual subjective truths, it is necessarily a subset of objective truth. Other people are not part of my subjective experience, they're a part of objective reality. And, just like other aspects of objective reality, there are fundamental limits to what I can possibly know about other people. At the lowest level, I might believe that another person is human just like me, but I could be plugged into the matrix & she is only a simulation of a person. Or maybe I'm on social media and she's simply a sock puppet controlled by a click farm in some other country.

The only things I can be sure of w regards to other people is my own worldview of them and the actions they take. If I ask someone what color they think the sky is, I can make good guesses at their subjective reality but make no mistake: our subjective realities are on two different planes of reality. Each consciousness exists only in the other person's objective reality and, collectively, we comprise a higher-order subjective reality that is a part of everyone's objective reality.

## Truth Distortions

When people talk about "the truth", they're generally conflating our consensus and the objective truth within their worldview. Conflating these two things is, almost always, a great heuristic & a wise move.

It's objectively true (w/in my worldview) that the sky is generally blue and we humans have a consensus that they sky is generally blue. Mixing up these two contexts of truth rarely comes with any downsides. Rarely, not never.

Trouble can arise when subjective and objective truth diverge. For example: Chernobyl. The consensus was that the Soviet Union is a highly-capable nuclear superpower and they build reactors that cannot possibly explode. The objective truth is that a Soviet RBMK reactor exploded. Things got very bad at Chernobyl & they didn't get better until the consensus caved-in and accepted the cold, hard, unyielding objective reality.

If you stay zoomed out, it looks like there would be no benefit to consensus diverging from objective truth. There's massive risk and no systemic benefit. One might think we'd all be happily working together to bring our collective consensus as closely in line with objective reality as possible.

Unfortunately, when you zoom in & notice individual incentives, you'll find a multi-polar trap: each individual benefits at the group's expense if they treat the subjective reality of those in power as more important/relevant/correct than objective reality.

This means subjective & objective truth will diverge most commonly & most severely close to power. Not watts, political power like what CEOs and Kings have.

From another angle, it looks like power over people can be used to fend off objective reality. With enough power, you can live out your subjective truth as if it were the one & only truth there ever was. For a little while at least. Objective reality is that which is still true when it's subjectively false though, be careful not to trip over it.

In practice, most people are, most of the time, not powerful enough to cause noticeable truth distortions so most of us live our day-to-day lives in a world where subjective & objective reality are essentially one and the same.

Which of the above statements are true?

We could claim that all of them are true, but some seem more true than others. Or, at least, some are true in different ways than others

I propose we can divide The Truth into two distinct categories: subjective truth & objective truth.

## Subjective Truth

Subjective truths are true within my subjective experience.

My subjective experience encapsulates everything that exists within my consciousness.

It is subjectively true that I can see a computer screen with words on it right now.
It is subjectively true that I am a little bit hungry.
It is subjectively true that I can hear Get Free by Lana Del Rey playing in the background.

Subjective truths are the lowest-level, most fundamental truths that can possibly exist.

There are some fun movies like The Matrix or Inception which play games with the fabric of reality, but subjective truths remain deeply true even if the fabric of reality were to shift from under our feet.

If I feel hungry, it doesn't matter whether I'm plugged into the Matrix or not, I'm still hungry. Whether I'm lost in a dream or a brain in a vat, I can be utterly and unshakably certain in the truth that I really do in fact feel hungry.

Of the above examples, "I am" stands out as being indisputably subjectively true for everyone capable of comprehending the statement.

Within my consciousness, there exists concepts of "sky" and "blue" and these concepts fit together in a way that feels true to me. If you do not believe that the sky is blue, then that statement would be subjectively false for you.

Subjective truths are set in stone and are not open to negotiation. If I say "I do not believe the sky is blue", nobody can argue with this and say "well actually you do believe so and so".

That said, subjective truths can obviously change, somebody could say "why don't you try going outside and looking at the sky" and maybe my subjective truth will change.

## Objective Truth

Objective truths are true if we can verify them in objective reality.

We could also refer to objective truths as "empirical truths" because they depend on going out into the real world and seeing for ourselves how things really are.

We could walk out of our house right now, look up at the sky and be somewhat certain in the objective truth of "the sky is blue" (or in the objective falsity of this statement if it happens to be stormy).

(I say "somewhat certain" because there are fundamental limits to what we can know about objective reality. We could be plugged into a matrix in which every possible experiment points to the conclusion that the sky is blue but in reality the sky is on fire or something. But, for the rest of this essay we'll set aside the possibility that reality is fundamentally different than it appears.)

Entropy is a bit non-obvious but, if you manage to wrap your head around it & run experiments, you'll find that it's among the deepest objective truths that we know.

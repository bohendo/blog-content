# What is true?

- The sky is blue
- I am
- 2 + 2 = 4
- entropy always increases
- the price of 1 ounce of gold was $1824.65 on Feb 14th, 2021 at 17:00 UTC
- Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election

Which of the above statements are true?

We could claim that all of them are true, but some seem more true than others. Or, at least, some are true in different ways than others

I propose we can divide The Truth into two distinct categories: subjective truth & objective truth.

## My subjective Truth

My subjective truths are true within my subjective experience.

My subjective experience encapsulates everything that exists within my consciousness.

It is subjectively true that I believe the sky is blue.
It is subjectively true that I am a little bit hungry.
It is subjectively true that I can hear Get Free by Lana Del Rey playing in the background.

An individual's subjective truths are the lowest-level, most fundamental truths that can possibly exist.

There are some fun movies like The Matrix or Inception which play games with the fabric of reality, but subjective truths remain deeply true even if the fabric of reality were to shift from under our feet.

If I feel hungry, it doesn't matter whether I'm plugged into the Matrix or not, I still feel hungry. Whether I'm lost in a dream or a brain in a vat, I can be utterly and unshakably certain in the truth that I really do in fact feel hungry.

Of the above examples, "I am" stands out as being indisputably subjectively true for everyone capable of comprehending the statement.

Within my consciousness, there exists concepts of "sky" and "blue" and these concepts fit together in a way that feels true to me. If you do not believe that the sky is blue, then that statement would be subjectively false for you.

Subjective truths are set in stone and are not open to negotiation. If I say "I do not believe the sky is blue", nobody can argue with this and say "well actually you do believe so and so".

That said, subjective truths can obviously change, somebody could say "why don't you try going outside and looking at the sky" and maybe my subjective truth will change.

## The Objective Truth

Objective truths are true if we can verify them in objective reality.

We could also refer to objective truths as "empirical truths" because they depend on going out into the real world and seeing for ourselves how things really are.

We could walk out of our house right now, look up at the sky and be somewhat certain in the objective truth of "the sky is blue" (or in the objective falsity of this statement if it happens to be stormy).

(I say "somewhat certain" because there are fundamental limits to what we can know about objective reality. We could be plugged into a matrix in which every possible experiment points to the conclusion that the sky is blue but in reality the sky is on fire or something. But, for the rest of this essay we'll set aside the possibility that reality is fundamentally different than it appears.)

Entropy is a bit non-obvious but, if you manage to wrap your head around it & run experiments, you'll find that it's among the deepest objective truths that we know. And, objectively, the global increase in entropy will remain true no matter what I subjectively believe to be true.

Reality is that which, when subjectively false, is still objectively true.

2 + 2 = 4 *feels* like an objective truth, it's math after all and math is a subject adjacent to science which is entirely focused on understanding objective reality. But, if we wanted to go out into the world and verify this statement, what would we look for? We'd try to add up 2..? Of what, exactly?

Abstract math is, counter-intuitively, not contained in the realm of objective reality. 2 + 2 = 4 is a purely subjective truth that depends entirely on your concept of what "2" in the abstract means. If I ask you "what comes after 12?", the answer would be different if our context is an abstract number line vs non-military-time hours of the day.

## The Subjective Truth

Notice that I qualified the earlier discussion of subjective truth by specifying it as "my" subjective truth or "an individual's" subjective truth.

There is another sense in which we can talk about subjective truth, that is: a group's subjective truth. Or, more broadly, humanity's subjective truth. I'll call it THE subjective truth.

As this is an emergent property of many people's individual subjective truths, it is necessarily a subset of objective truth. Other people are not part of my subjective experience, they're a part of objective reality. And, just like other aspects of objective reality, there are fundamental limits to what I can possibly know about other people. At the lowest level, I might believe that another person is human just like me, but I could be plugged into the matrix & she is only a simulation of a person.

The only things I can be 100% sure of w regards to other people is my own subjective interpretations of the objective realities of the actions other people take. If I ask someone what color they think the sky is, I can make good guesses at their subjective reality based on the answer I receive.

## The Truth

When people talk about the truth, they're generally conflating the subjective truth and objective truth. Conflating these two things is, almost always, a great heuristic & a wise move.

It's objectively true that the sky is blue and it's subjectively true that they sky is blue. We so rarely need to differentiate between different sources of truth that it's easy to forget there's more than one.

But trouble can arise when subjective and objective truth do diverge.

For example: Chernobyl: The subjective truth was that the Soviet Union is a highly-capable nuclear superpower and they build reactors that cannot possibly explode. The objective truth is that a Soviet RBMK reactor definitely exploded. Things got very bad at Chernobyl & they didn't get better until the subjective truth caved-in and accepted objective reality.

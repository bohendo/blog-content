# What is Moral?

## Definition

An action is moral if it stabilizes society.

### First principal: Morality is a story we tell ourselves, not objective.

There is no "true" morality encoded into the universe. If a fire burns, it's because it has a steady flow of oxygen and hydrocarbon fuel. Whether the fire is keeping a house cozy in the winter or quietly burning it down at night is irrelevant to the way the universe unfolds.

The heat death of the universe is coming

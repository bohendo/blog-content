## Intro

Dal makhani is a classic Indian dish, famous for how long it takes to cook. It's fairly simple though without requiring a huge amount of attention so it's still an easy enough recipe to prepare, just make sure you start cooking in the morning or the day before you want to eat it.

This dish, like many Indian dishes, gets better the longer it sits & soaks in it's own spices so make sure you prepare enough to have plenty of leftovers, doubling this recipe is probably a good idea. I often find that dal makhani tastes best on the 2nd or 3rd day after cooking.

## Notes

This recipe assumes you're using a pressure cooker but it's not strictly required. If you're cooking it openly w/out pressure, follow these same directions except with all cooking times tripled.

Tarka (Also spelled tadka or, in Hindi: तर्क ) is a Hindi word describing a spicy oily mixture. The oil is heated and ingredients are added so that the hot oil absorbs rich flavors from the spices.

## Ingredients
- 1 cup urad dal (aka black gram aka [vigna mungo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_mungo))
- 1/3 cup rajma (aka red kidney beans)
- 3/4 cup butter & 1/2 cup ghee (or just 5/4 cups of butter)
- 3 tablespoons of degi mirch (blend of red capsicum and red chili powder but using just red chili powder is fine too)
- 10ish cloves of garlic or 1/3 cup minced garlic
- 4ish medium tomatoes or 1.5 cups of tomato puree
- 1/3 cup cream
- 1 tablespoon kasuri methi (optional, I often just use a little extra red chili powder instead)

## Preparation

- rinse rajma & dal several times or until the water stays clear.

*Before doing any more prep, make sure you've started softening and/or cooking the beans*

- wash, dice, and blend the tomatoes into a puree. Alternatively, you can just use tomato paste directly.
- peel and mince the garlic cloves if you're using fresh garlic.

## Procedure

### Soften beans

- Soak the dal & rajma overnight (8-24 hours) OR pressure cook them for 45 minutes.

### Cook beans

- Strain the beans & discard the water they softened in.
- Add 1/2 cup butter & plenty of water.
- Cook the dal for 30 more minutes.
- Mash the beans a little to get a creamy texture.

### Tarka Round 1

- In a separate pan, heat 1/4 cup ghee with 1 tablespoon of degi mirch and a spoonful of water.
- Add all the minced garlic & let it cook briefly.
- Add all the tomato puree & cook a bit longer.
- Add this oily spice mixture to the dal.
- Cook dal for 30 more minutes.

### Tarka Round 2

- In a separate pan add 1/4 cup ghee w 1 tablespoon of degi mirch & 1 tablespoon of kasuri methi & a splash of water. Heat briefly then add to dal.
- Cook the dal for a while without a lid to boil off excess water until it's reached the desired consistence. Usually, we cook it for 2-4 hours but, in general, the longer you cook it the better.

### Final Prep

- Add another 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup of cream, stir well. The dal will likely be just a hint too spicy before this step but the cream will cool it down. If it's still too spicy, add more cream as needed.
- Serve with a topping of cream.

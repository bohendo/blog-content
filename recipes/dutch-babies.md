# Dutch Baby Pancakes

Our family enjoys this recipe on Christmas & other special mornings.

## Ingredients
- 240g milk (~1 cup)
- 100g egg (~2x)
- 85g butter (~2/5 cups)
- 85g flour (~2/3 cup)
- 25g sugar (~2 tbsp)
- 3g lemon rind (~1/2 tsp)
- 3g cardamom (~6 pods or ~1/2 tsp powder)
- 3g salt (~1/2 tsp)

## Preparation

- If using whole cardamom pods, peel & blend/crush them first.

## Procedure

- Preheat oven to 400°F/200°C.
- While the oven's preheating, put the baking pan (traditionally: a 9 1/2 in pie pan) with butter into the oven until the butter completely melts.
- Mix milk, sugar, salt, eggs, lemon rind, and cardamom in a blender. Blend for 1-3 minutes to ensure the batter is smooth & lightly foamy. Add flour to the blender and blend very briefly, just enough to mix it well.
- Take the pan with melted butter out of the oven & swirl it to ensure the sides all have a nice coating of butter.
- Pour the batter into the butter-filled pan.
- Bake for 12-15 minutes (20-25 mins if recipe is doubled) or until the middle is firm, the top is golden brown and the sides are puffing up slightly.
- Remove from oven & serve slices immediately. Top each slice with a dusting of powdered sugar & a drizzle of lemon juice.
- Enjoy!

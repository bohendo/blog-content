# Bo's Blog

Welcome to my blog!


## Goals

I want to document my worldview as it changes over time. In 5 year's time (but hopefully less), I bet I'll enjoy looking back on my worldview today and chuckling at how childish & immature it was.

The purpose of this blog is to lay my thoughts & beliefs bare for the world to see in a way that is transparent & honest.

### Transparency

The content of this blog is [open source](https://gitlab.com/bohendo/blog-content) & auditable. It's managed via git which, like all great blockchains, features an immutable history.

Along with each post, you'll find a few control knobs for browsing a post's edit history. Historical versions will never change or disappear. You can be sure you're looking at an immutable copy of a post if the url path starts with 8 characters of garbage & looks something like `/137b1699/about`.

If you'd like to write a hit piece about me, this makes your job easy. Copy the permalink to a page and, if it contains a mistake, your link will always point to that mistake, even if I fix it later.

Every post is a perpetual work in progress, nothing I write will ever be "done". As I gain a better understanding of some subject, I will be continuously pushing updates. You can be sure you're looking at the most up-to-date version of a post if the url path does *not* start with 8 characters of garbage eg `/about`.

### Honesty

Honest communication is, in my opinion, an end-goal all on it's own. I'm writing this to fulfil my end of the conversation and, by reading it, you're fulfilling yours. Thank you. :grin:


## Anti-Goals

Hopefully my goal for this blog will come into focus if I clarify what I'm *not* trying to do here.

### Change The World

I don't want to be a thought leader. I don't want to alter the course of history. I *absolutely* don't want to lead any sort of political movement.

There is a romantic notion of "speaking truth to power" but I don't wish to speak to power at all. Power distorts truth. If & when the powerful lie to the powerless, I hope that this blog is somewhere the powerless can come to be reassured that no, you aren't crazy. The reality you see is the same reality I see even if power is mixed up between reality and what it things ought to be reality.

### Change Your Mind

I believe there's a trade-off between freedom and power. The more power you have, the more responsibility you have. The more responsibility you have, the more your actions are constrained by what's good for other people (unless you're a psychopath).

I barely know what's good for myself, let alone other people. I care more about having the freedom to write about *anything* than stressing out about whether I'm giving people good advice or harmful advice. Therefore, I try not to give any advice at all.

I don't want to hurt anyone, I don't want to get sued, I don't want to change your mind. I abdicate every last shred of power I might have over your decisions and give it entirely to you.

### Drive Traffic

I do not want to artificially drive traffic to this site. This site is not designed with SEO in mind and I don't particularly care how or whether search engines page rank this site.

If you're reading this, I hope you're here because one of your friends sent you. If my friends do pass this blog on to their friends & my readership grows organically, that's cool w me, but it'd be a happy side effect rather than my end goal.

### Collect Data

There's no silly pop-up begging you to let me store cookies because this site collects zero information about you.

That is, until you click the light/dark theme toggle in the side drawer. Then it remembers whether you like the lights on or off. If you don't want me to store that data about you, then don't toggle the theme.

### Get Rich

This blog's hosting fees are covered by an ETH2 validator. As long as it doesn't get too popular, I should be able to keep this blog hosted until I die w/out any more capital input.


## Disclaimers

In general, it's safe to assume I'm not qualified to write about whatever I write about. But I'm going to write about it anyway and if you chose to read, keep my utter lack of credentials in mind.

### I Am Not A Doctor

Nothing in this blog should be interpreted as medical advice. I'm not a doctor nor am I attempting to role-play one.

I might discuss my own medical history and actions I take to manage my own health but that doesn't mean I'm recommending you do the same.

### I Am Not A Lawyer

Nothing in this blog should be interpreted as legal advice. I'm not a lawyer nor a certified public account nor am I trying to role-play as any sort of legal professional.

I might discuss my experience interacting with various legal systems but that doesn't imply that any actions I describe are legal or even remotely advisable.

### I Am Not An Expert

If you want to quote me on anything I've written, you're welcome to but I suggest you qualify it with "some rando with a blog says.." instead of implying that I know what I'm talking about.

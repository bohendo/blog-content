Backgammon is fun, it has it's own little set of jargon to aid discussion:

- Checker: the white or black pieces that move around.
- Point: one of the light or dark triangles where a checker can rest.
- Blot: A lone checker, vulnerable to being hit.
- Hit: Landing a checker on an opponent's blot sends that piece to the bar.
- Bar: The thick line through the middle of the board, where pieces go once they've been hit, kinda like point #25.
- Pip: The distance between two adjacent points. Also, the value of each dot on the dice.

## Rules

- TBD

## Strategy
- Exposing blots is bad, avoid that. Hitting your opponents blots is good, try to do that.

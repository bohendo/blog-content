The Investment Game

This is a fiction story about the game of investing. 

In this game, you start out in a large lobby holding a wad of cash. You're surrounded by a sea of free-standing glass-elevators which are perpetually, and almost randomly, rising and falling.

Your goal is to raise your money up as high as possible without letting any crash through the floor.

You start out cautious, putting a bit of money in a slow-moving elevator marked SPY. It has a good reputation & is supposedly a safe bet.

It takes a long time to rise very far though, you get bored & start searching for alternatives.

You put a little more money into a wilder elevator marked TSLA. This one shot way up just a while ago & you're hoping for a repeat performance.

You look up and, as if synchronized, all of the elevators drop. Some just a tiny bit, others crashed way down below the floor.

You don't know what happened but you're not feeling good about it. You withdraw your money back to cash on solid ground.

And then, vertigo. Your stomach flips as you see all of the elevators rise up a bit. Even the elevator marked HTZ, that one was supposed to be damaged & in need of repairs, what's it doing so far up?

You lurch & struggle to catch your balance. You rub your eyes & look around at your surroundings more closely for the first time.. This floor, that design on the wall, it's just like..

You have your first sickening realization: there is no solid ground. Only elevators.

You look up & see the engraving: USD

A nearby elevator is rising slowly.. Or wait, no it's standing still but you're sinking. What you thought was solid ground is actually descending, ever so slowly down.

For a moment you're dumbstruck & then delighted! "Wow I can raise my money more easily now!" you say to yourself "even by standing still I'm getting ahead."

You completely abandon the giant USD lobby-sized elevator & jump into the nearest one you see. You feel very clever. As long as the USD floor is sinking, this elevator doesn't even need to rise that fast, even standing still is enough for you to get ahead.

And then, more vertigo.

You see the massive USD surface rise up towards you and then quickly pass & continue rising up above you. You are in free fall. What elevator are you even on? You didn't check before getting in but now it's too late, you're way down past the floor. 

You look up and see the engraving XRP as you have your second sickening realization: actually there is solid ground. At zero.

# Operations Security

I don't believe in security through obscurity. Knowing how my opsec works shouldn't make it meaningfully weaker. If that's the case, then I'd rather find out sooner rather than later so I can fix it.

## Passwords

The Keys to my Kingdom  32 randomly generated letters (`/dev/random`) split into two Strong Passwords 💪 16 letters each.

The first Strong Password 💪 protects the Key 🔑 to my Vault 🏦 (KeePassX) which contains passwords for stuff like Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc and some Crypto Hot Wallets 🔥.

The Password Vault 🏦 itself is saved Dropbox so I can easily sync new accounts between my devices. Eg, for a new device to sign into my Paypal account, it needs:
 1. The Password Vault 🏦 from Dropbox
 2. A Strong Password 💪 stored in my brain
 3. The vault Key 🔑 file, copied from old device -> new device via usb cable.

The second Strong Password 💪 protects my ssh Keys 🔑 & I'd use it to protect pgp encryption keys if I ever actually used those.

The first half of of this second Strong Password 💪 is the unlock code for my phone & computer. 

# Brain wallet management

First of all, if it's important, then write it down somewhere.

Does this make your brain wallet less secure?

Less secure from what? There are two ways to lose access to these funds: someone steals them or you accidentally burn them. A brain wallet without a backup is vulnerable to burn-by-head-injury & just plain forgetfulness.

You're not immortal either. Do you really want this secret to be burned along with you at the crematory?

A note card hidden in some nook only you know about (but somewhere that might still be searched by loved ones if you die) is good.

NOT somewhere digital. Not a note on your phone not a file on your computer. Go for good old fashion pencil & paper.

Secondly, write it at least once per week. If you don't plan to write it frequently (eg to enter your password vault to sign into google) then it probably shouldn't be in your brain. Brain wallets are not the place to store something that you'll only need "just in case".

I unlock my ssh password every time I reboot my computer so that keeps it fresh.

To memorize random strings of letters & numbers in the first place, muscle memory's where you want to store it. Open a temp note & just write it over and over 25 or 50 times. Then, leave it as the unlock code for your computer for week or so to really let it sink it before re-assigning it to it's final resting place.

Crypto degenerate here, I know you all dgaf about crypto but if I've invested a third of my net worth into WBTC-ETH LP tokens then I should at least be able to describe why even if just for myself. I'm hella bullish & am planning to maintain this position for years.

Uniswap 101:
 - LP = Liquidity Provider aka give the exchange funds that it can use to fulfil trades
 - Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that runs on Ethereum, Uniswap is a crypto-coinbase the same way that BTC is crypto-gold.
 - The 'W' prefix of WBTC stands for 'wrapped' which means the token is wrapped into a standard (ERC20) token interface so that Ethereum-based tools like Uniswap can treat all assets the same. For the most part, you can ignore the 'W' prefix & pretend this is BTC since the price action is basically the same.
 - Uniswap is divided into pairs, every pair of two assets that you can trade on uniswap has a separate pool of liquidity. Other pairs I've previously supplied liquidity to are ETH-DAI, ETH-UNI, and ETH-YFI.
 - You can ONLY supply liquidity in the form of 50-50 value of the two pair tokens, eg if the current price of 1 BTC is 25 ETH, then you must supply liquidity at a 1:25 ratio.
 - When you supply liquidity, you receive LP tokens which can be redeemed for your share of the liquidity, when you redeem you'll receive your liquidity at the CURRENT exchange rate, not the exchange rate you originally deposited at.
 - Uniswap as an AMM aka automated market maker aka there is no order book. Just the big pool of funds and the price is set automatically based on how much reserves a pair has. Eg if a pair as total reserves of 1 BTC and 25 ETH then that sets the current ETH-BTC exchange rate. Every trade changes the price, big trades change the price a lot but afterwards arbitragers will trade & reset the price to fair market value.

Moon Math:
 - These numbers are coming from: https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xbb2b8038a1640196fbe3e38816f3e67cba72d940
 - In the last 24 hours, the WBTC-ETH pair on Uniswap did ~$45M in trade volume
 - Uniswap charges a 0.3% fee on all trades. Fee times volume = ~$135k in fees collected during the last 24 hours
 - fees are distributed to people who provide liquidity, if you provide 0.1% of the liquidity, then you collect 0.1% of the fees aka $135 in the last 24 hours

DANGER:
 - The fees are collected as 50-50 of the two pair tokens. If the two pair tokens both rise in terms of USD, then what used to be $135/day in fees might be later sold for a lot more.. Or a lot less.
 - Divergent loss aka impermanent loss is a subtle yet dangerous thing.

## by Scott Adams

 - loc 97 - loserthink wherever you encounter it, in others and in yourself. We humans give greater weight to things that have names. And giving loserthink its name creates a shorthand way of mocking people who practice unproductive thinking.

 - loc 98 - We humans give greater weight to things that have names. And giving loserthink its name creates a shorthand way of mocking people who practice unproductive thinking.

 - loc 110 - The risk of mockery changes behavior. I would go so far as to say it is one of history’s most powerful forces.

 - loc 124 - The difference is that stupid refers to a person whereas loserthink applies to the technique. And keep in mind that all of us engage in loserthink sometimes. The loser part of loserthink refers to the outcome, not the DNA of the person involved. Remember to make that distinction if you use the term. Calling people stupid will not make them turn smart, but pointing out a bad technique and contrasting it with a good one

The loser part of loserthink refers to the outcome, not the DNA of the person involved. Remember to make that distinction if you use the term. Calling people stupid will not make them turn smart, but pointing out a bad technique and contrasting it with a good one can, in time, move people to a more productive way of thinking.

 - loc 292 - Mental prison: The illusions and unproductive thinking that limit our ability to see the world clearly and act upon it rationally

 - loc 313 - The “magic” in a magic show is mysterious only until you hear how it is done. Likewise, when I explain to you the walls of your mental prisons, the walls will first become more visible and then start to dissolve with little or no effort on your part.

 - loc 346 - Ethics is a separate and important issue, but it isn’t predictive in the context of capitalism. If something is legal and profitable, it will happen, a lot.

 - loc 358 - If you buy into the full-scary narratives promoted by either the political left or the political right, you’re probably experiencing loserthink. A more useful way to think of the political news is that nearly every major story is exaggerated to the point of falsehood, with the intention of scaring the public.

 - loc 367 - Being absolutely right and being spectacularly wrong feel exactly the same.

 - loc 479 - People who have good arguments use them. People who do not have good arguments try to win by labeling.

 - loc 757 - As a rule, we can’t always tell the difference between the people who are far smarter than us and the people who are dumber. Both groups make choices we can’t understand. That’s an important thing to keep in mind. If your opinion is that another person’s idea is terrible, you can only be sure that at least one of you is stupid.

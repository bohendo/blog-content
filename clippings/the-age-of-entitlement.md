 - loc 74 - The changes of the 1960s, with civil rights at their core, were not just a major new element in the Constitution. They were a rival constitution, with which the original one was frequently incompatible—and the incompatibility would worsen as the civil rights regime was built out.

 - loc 110 - By expanding the federal Civil Rights Commission (Title V); by subjecting to bureaucratic scrutiny any company or institution that received government money (Title VI); by laying out hiring practices for all companies with more than 15 employees; by creating a new presidential agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), with the power to file lawsuits, conduct investigations, and order redress—by doing all these things, the act emboldened and incentivized bureaucrats, lawyers, intellectuals, and political agitators to become the “eyes and ears,” and even the foot soldiers, of civil rights enforcement

 - loc 165 - The Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts provided permanent emergency powers to smash the sham democracy of the segregated South. They mixed surveillance by volunteers, litigation by lawyers, and enforcement by bureaucrats. This was a new model of federal government, with a transformative power that was immediately apparent.

 - loc 165 - The Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts provided permanent emergency powers to smash the sham democracy of the segregated South. They mixed surveillance by volunteers, litigation by lawyers, and enforcement by bureaucrats. This was a new model of federal government, with a transformative power that was immediately apparent. Thoroughgoing and versatile, often able to bypass the separation of powers, civil rights law became the template for much of American policy making after the 1960s, including on matters far removed from race.

 - loc 185 - Harvard Law School professor Herbert Wechsler described Brown as “an opinion which is often read with less fidelity by those who praise it than by those by whom it is condemned”

 - loc 197 - And once the Civil Rights Act introduced into the private sector this assumption that all separation was prima facie evidence of inequality, desegregation implied a revocation of the old freedom of association altogether. Just as assuming that two parallel lines can meet overturns much of Euclidean geometry, eliminating freedom of association from the U.S. Constitution changed everything.

 - loc 208 - “The prohibition against every ‘discrimination’ would mean the abolition of the private sphere, the denial of the difference between the state and society, in a word, the destruction of liberal society.”

 - loc 236 - Where a shared heritage is absent or unrecognized, as it is in the contemporary United States, all the eggs of national cohesion are placed in the basket of the constitution. Hence a paradox: With the dawn of the civil rights era, the U.S. Constitution—the very thing that made it possible for an ethnically varied nation to live together—came under stress. The problem is that rights cannot simply be “added” to a social contract without

 - loc 236 - Where a shared heritage is absent or unrecognized, as it is in the contemporary United States, all the eggs of national cohesion are placed in the basket of the constitution. Hence a paradox: With the dawn of the civil rights era, the U.S. Constitution—the very thing that made it possible for an ethnically varied nation to live together—came under stress. The problem is that rights cannot simply be “added” to a social contract without changing it. To establish new liberties is to extinguish others.

 - loc 247 - “real freedom will require many changes in the nation’s political and social philosophies and institutions. For one thing we must destroy the notion that Mrs. Murphy’s property rights include the right to humiliate me because of the color of my skin. The sanctity of private property takes second place to the sanctity of the human personality.” And so it was after the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Property simply would not enjoy the same constitutional protection that it had before.

Property simply would not enjoy the same constitutional protection that it had before.

 - loc 342 - Subcommunities, as Glazer called them, were often suspicious, hostile to outsiders. They were also indispensable for giving people of humble prospects a dignified place in the social order, and keeping the ruthless machinery of market competition at bay. “The force of present-day Negro demands,” Glazer wrote, “is that the subcommunity, because it either protects privileges or creates inequality, has no right to exist.” Now government would set about destroying those subcommunities—eventually doing so in the name of “diversity,”

 - loc 370 - The civil rights movement was not precisely a movement of civil rights, in the sense of giving American blacks access to the ordinary rights of cives, or citizens. If it had been, the laws would not have required changing, only enforcing.

 - loc 374 - term “civil rights” survived even as the approach failed. What was being fought over in the 1960s was something different from civil rights. It was a conception of human rights that had arisen in the twentieth century.

 - loc 433 - The legislation of the mid-1960s made legal equality a fact of American life. To the surprise of much of the country, though, legal equality was now deemed insufficient by both civil rights leaders and the government. Once its ostensible demands had

 - loc 435 - Once its ostensible demands had been met, the civil rights movement did not disband. It grew.

 - loc 435 - Once its ostensible demands had been met, the civil rights movement did not disband. It grew. It turned into a lobby or political bloc seeking to remedy the problem according to what Freeman would call the victims’ view: “lack of jobs, lack of money, lack of housing.” The federal government made it a central part of its mission to procure those things for blacks.

 - loc 477 - In Griggs v. Duke Power Co. (1971), the Supreme Court justices asked whether a power plant in North Carolina could give aptitude tests to its employees. Title VII (Section 703) of the Civil Rights Act had said they could. But Chief Justice Warren Burger and a unanimous Court decided they could not, if such tests disadvantaged blacks in any way: “Good intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures or testing mechanisms that operated as ‘built-in headwinds’ for minority groups,” Burger wrote. Government could now disrupt and steer interactions that had been considered the private affairs of private citizens—their roles as businessmen or landlords or members of college admissions boards. It could interfere in matters of personal discretion

 - loc 484 - the Griggs decision made clear that the government was now authorized to act against racism even if there was no evidence of any racist intent. This was an opening to arbitrary power. And once arbitrary power is conferred, it matters little what it was conferred for.

 - loc 487 - In 1966, former B-movie actor Ronald Reagan, an opponent of both the Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts, unseated California governor Edmund “Pat” Brown, a popular public servant and master campaigner. The episode was so bewildering to the educated classes that Commentary magazine commissioned the Harvard political scientist James Q. Wilson, himself a native Californian of humble origins, to write a “Guide to Reagan Country” for its readers.

The episode was so bewildering to the educated classes that Commentary magazine commissioned the Harvard political scientist James Q. Wilson, himself a native Californian of humble origins, to write a “Guide to Reagan Country” for its readers. “I do not intend here to write an apology for Reagan,” Wilson explained at the outset. “Even if I thought like that, which I don’t, I would never write it down anywhere my colleagues at Harvard might read it.”

 - loc 499 - The idea that it could be a permanent solution to the problem of racial prejudice required doublethink. “Affirmative action requires the use of race as a socially significant category of perception and representation,” as Kimberlé Crenshaw and her colleagues put it, “but the deepest elements of mainstream civil rights ideology had come to identify such race-consciousness as racism itself.”

 - loc 523 - The civil rights movement was a template. The new system for overthrowing the traditions that hindered black people became the model for overthrowing every tradition in American life, starting with the roles of men and women.

 - loc 776 - Workplace feminism exacerbated inequality. It increased the number of intra-class marriages, and it undermined the New Deal culture of the “family wage”—the common-sense assumption among Americans of all classes that a wage paid to a “working man” went to support his wife and children as well.

 - loc 785 - It was feminism that provided, under pressure of the recessions of the 1970s, a pretext for repurposing household and national budgets. Instead of being used for reproduction (understood as both family-forming and investment), those budgets would now be consumed.

 - loc 904 - It is hard to say exactly what, but there must be a reason that flourishing, fertile, creative societies tend to be conservative about sex.

 - loc 917 - My belief is, though I put it forward with some hesitation, that the elimination of paternity as a recognized social relation would tend to make men’s emotional life trivial and thin, causing in the end a slowly growing boredom and despair, in which procreation would gradually die out, leaving the human race to be replenished by stocks that had preserved the older convention.

 - loc 968 - The ERA promised to feminize public space just as the civil rights acts had promised to desegregate it. People didn’t want that. As early as the spring of 1975, among those who blocked its passage, the reason most often cited was that “equal rights for women could eventually end up destroying the institution of marriage and family life.”

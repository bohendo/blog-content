 - loc 90 - I shared my fear with him - what would people think?  His response, something that I will never forget and will always be grateful for: "I don't do a post now unless I'm worried about what people will think about me."

 - loc 117 - "This day, I vow to myself to love myself, to treat myself as someone I love truly and deeply - in my thoughts, my actions, the choices I make, the experiences I have, each moment I am conscious, I make the decision I LOVE MYSELF."

 - loc 261 - If I loved myself truly and deeply, would I let myself experience this?

 - loc 378 - James Altucher, in one of his best blog posts, talks about how he stops negative thoughts in their tracks with a simple mind trick.  "Not useful," he tells himself.  It's a switch, a breaker of sorts, shifts the pattern of the fear.

 - loc 456 - I once asked a monk how he found peace. "I say 'yes,'" he'd said.  "To all that happens, I say 'yes.'"

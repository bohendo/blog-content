#  Awaken the Giant Within
## by Tony Robbins

 - loc 301 - Any time you sincerely want to make a change, the first thing you must do is to raise your standards. When people ask me what really changed my life eight years ago, I tell them that absolutely the most important thing was changing what I demanded of myself. I wrote down all the things I would no longer accept in my life, all the things I would no longer tolerate, and all the things that I aspired to becoming.

 - loc 310 - If you raise your standards but don’t really believe you can meet them, you’ve already sabotaged yourself. You won’t even try;

 - loc 322 - One of my core beliefs is that if you set a higher standard, and you can get yourself to believe, then you certainly can figure out the strategies. You simply will find a way.

 - loc 324 - the best strategy in almost any case is to find a role-model, someone who’s already getting the results you want, and then tap into their knowledge.

 - loc 331 - You see, in life, lots of people know what to do, but few people actually do what they know.

 - loc 458 - It’s not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently.

 - loc 1782 - Managing operating systems on workstations boils down to three basic tasks: loading the system software and applications initially, updating the system software and applications, and configuring network parameters. We call these tasks the Big Three.

 - loc 1789 - We define a workstation as computer hardware dedicated to a single customer’s work.

 - loc 1800 - New refers to a completely new machine. • Clean refers to a machine on which the OS has been installed but no localizations performed. • Configured means a correctly configured and operational environment. • Unknown is a computer that has been misconfigured or has become out of date. • Off refers to a machine that has been retired and powered off.

 - loc 1846 - In this chapter, we use the term platform to mean a specific vendor/OS combination.

 - loc 2450 - The System Administrators’ Guild (SAGE) (www.sage.org) and the League of Professional System Administrators (LOPSA) (www.lopsa.org) are good resources for the SA community

 - loc 2481 - mean time to repair (MTTR)

 - loc 2516 - medium-size sites can sometimes negotiate to have the regional spares kit stored on their site, with the benefit that the technician is more likely to hang out near your building. Sometimes, it is possible to negotiate direct access to the spares kit on an emergency basis. (Usually, this is done without the knowledge of the technician’s management.)

#  An Elegant Puzzle

## by Will Larson

 - loc 253 - An important property of teams is that they abstract the complexities of the individuals that compose them. Teams with fewer than four individuals are a sufficiently leaky abstraction that they function indistinguishably from individuals.

 - loc 257 - Keep innovation and maintenance together. A frequent practice is to spin up a new team to innovate while existing teams are bogged down in maintenance. I’ve historically done this myself, but I’ve moved toward innovating within existing teams.5 This requires very deliberate decision-making and some bravery, but in exchange you’ll get higher morale and a culture of learning, and will avoid creating a two-tiered class system of innovators and maintainers.

 - loc 261 - Fitting together those guiding principles, the playbook that I’ve developed is surprisingly simple and effective: Teams should be six to eight during steady state. To create a new team, grow an existing team to eight to ten, and then bud into two teams of four or five. Never create empty teams. Never leave managers supporting more than eight individuals.

 - loc 347 - Fundamentally, I believe that sustained productivity comes from high-performing teams, and that disassembling a high-performing team leads to a significant loss of productivity, even if the members are fully retained. In this worldview, high-performing teams are sacred, and I’m quite hesitant to disassemble them.

 - loc 374 - I’ve found it much easier to work a couple constraints at a time, solving forward without needing to revisit previous constraints. The Goal by Eliyahu M. Goldratt10 and Thinking in Systems: A Primer by Donella H. Meadows11 are both phenomenal books on this topic.

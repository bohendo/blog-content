#  Self Knowledge

 - loc 47 - When you did the exercise and your mind kept wandering back to what you had to do at work tomorrow, who was it that was watching your mind worry about work tomorrow? It was your mind watching your mind. In Zen they refer to this as the “Thinking Mind” and the “Observing Mind” – the two minds.

 - loc 54 - The problem with the Thinking Mind is that we don’t completely control it.

 - loc 64 - Our Thinking Mind is like a horny dog on a leash that keeps running after things and if we aren’t used to using our Observing Mind, then our Thinking Mind drags us along with it.

 - loc 75 - In Zen, they advise that instead of saying, “I am angry,” to say, “I feel anger.” Instead of saying, “I am nervous,” say, “I feel nervousness.” Instead of saying, “I am jealous,” you say, “I feel jealousy.”

 - loc 118 - “My boss is not an idiot. But I am having the thought that my boss is an idiot.” “I don’t hate my ex-girlfriend. I am feeling hatred toward my ex-girlfriend.” “I am not lonely and depressed. I am feeling loneliness and depression.” Language is very powerful. Notice when you disidentify from these emotions and thoughts in this way it 1) implies that they’re temporary states, and not permanent conditions and 2) forces you to take responsibility for them. They’re nobody’s fault, they just are.

 - loc 126 - “Thank you Thinking Mind for feeling nervous before my date tonight. It will keep me on my toes!” “Thank you Thinking Mind for being angry at my boss. I really appreciate how much you care.” This is going to feel really bizarre – expressing gratitude towards negative emotions. But I think you’ll find that it diminishes the power of the thoughts and emotions over time and actually impels you to take action despite them.

 - loc 230 - It doesn’t matter whether a belief is true or not; what matters is whether it’s helpful. Believing you are ugly, or undesirable, or not interesting enough – these may or may not be true in various circumstances. But they can never be proven one way or another. So why not assume they’re untrue? What do you have to lose?

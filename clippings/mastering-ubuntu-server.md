#  Mastering Ubuntu Server

 - loc 326 - If I can make any recommendation, it would be to utilize both physical and virtual servers if you can. Not because this book requires you to, but because it's a good habit to get into.

 - loc 336 - Every server must have a purpose, also known as its Role. This role could be that of a database server, web server, and so on. Basically, it's the value the server adds to your network or your organization.

 - loc 551 - While there are certainly better ways of handling excessive logging (log rotating, disk quotas, and so on), a separate partition also would have helped.

 - loc 585 - While doing a memory test can add considerable time to the installation process, I definitely recommend it, especially if the hardware is new and hasn't ever been tested at all. In fact, I make it a process to test the RAM of all my servers once or twice a year, so this media can be used as a memory tester any time you need one.

 - loc 840 - Ubuntu defaults to locking out the root account altogether. This is very much unlike many other distributions.

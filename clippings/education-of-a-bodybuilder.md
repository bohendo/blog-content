 - loc 167 - He felt I wasn’t normal. And of course he was right. With my desire and my drive, I definitely wasn’t normal. Normal people can be happy with a regular life. I was different.

 - loc 197 - “It’s not your body, Arnold. Your body can’t change that much from one day to the next. It’s in your mind. On some days your goals are just clearer. On the bad days you need someone to help get you going.

 - loc 207 - I discovered that the secret of successful workouts had to do with competition.

 - loc 243 - My total involvement had a lot to do with the discipline, the individualism, and the utter integrity of bodybuilding.

 - loc 254 - I wanted to get bigger so I could really impress the girls who liked it and upset the others even more. Not that girls were my main reason for training. Far from it. But they added incentive and I figured as long as I was getting this attention from them I might as well use it.

 - loc 254 - I wanted to get bigger so I could really impress the girls who liked it and upset the others even more. Not that girls were my main reason for training. Far from it. But they added incentive and I figured as long as I was getting this attention from them I might as well use it. I had fun. I could tell if a girl was repelled by my size. And when I’d catch her looking at me in disbelief, I would casually raise my arm, flex my bicep, and watch her cringe. It was always good for a laugh.

 - loc 277 - I couldn’t be bothered with girls as companions. My mind was totally locked into working out, and I was annoyed if anything took me away from it.

 - loc 331 - Helmut insisted that if I achieved something in life, I shouldn’t thank God for it, I should thank myself. It was the same if something bad happened. I shouldn’t ask God for help, I should help myself. He asked me if I’d ever prayed for my body. I confessed I had. He said if I wanted a great body, I had to build it. Nobody else could. Least of all God.

 - loc 366 - I’d always had a claustrophobic feeling about Austria. “I’ve got to get out of here,” I kept thinking. “It’s not big enough, it’s stifling.” It wouldn’t allow me to expand. There seemed never to be enough space. Even people’s ideas were small. There was too much contentment, too much acceptance of things as they’d always been.

 - loc 373 - I was always honest about my weak points. This helped me grow. I think it’s the key to success in everything: be honest; know where you’re weak; admit it. There is nobody in bodybuilding without some areas that need work.

 - loc 443 - “No, no, no,” he said and laughed. “You can’t do that. Those guys are big bulls. They’re big animals—so huge you wouldn’t believe it. You don’t want to compete against them. Not yet.” He talked as though they were years and years ahead of me. But as far as I was concerned, he had promised me a trip to London to the contest, and I was going to do what I wanted. “If I go over there, I’m going to compete,” I told him, “not to watch.” He laughed and said, “Sure.”

 - loc 443 - Anything that causes you to overreact or underreact can control you, and often does.

 - loc 553 - All that year, training for the Mr. Universe contest, I had not seriously expected to win (which was a kind of thinking I was never again to accept from myself):

 - loc 640 - I was relying on one thing. What I had more than anyone else was drive. I was hungrier than anybody. I wanted it so badly it hurt. I knew there could be no one else in the world who wanted this title as much as I did.

 - loc 809 - When you have a BMW, which drives well although it’s not a great car, you try to race with everybody to prove that it has speed. But when you have a Ferrari or a Lamborghini you know you can beat anybody on the street. You don’t race any more. You start driving 55 on the freeway.

 - loc 817 - I knew I was a winner. I knew I was destined for great things. People will say that kind of thinking is totally immodest. I agree. Modesty is not a word that applies to me in any way—I hope it never will.

 - loc 822 - Because of my strict parents, I was very disciplined. However, I didn’t get certain things I needed as a child, and that, I think, finally made me hungry for achievement, for winning in other ways, for being the best, being recognized. If I’d gotten everything and been well-balanced, I wouldn’t have had my drive. So, as a result of this negative element in my upbringing, I had a positive drive toward success and recognition.

 - loc 829 - I trained twelve months of the year, really hard, with no letup. Most of the bodybuilders didn’t do that. I sacrificed a lot of things most bodybuilders didn’t want to give up. I just didn’t care, I wanted to win more than anything. And whatever it took to do it, I did.

 - loc 1106 - I asked why I should feel it there, and my doctor friend came up with the answer that the biceps’ job is not only to lift the forearm up to flex but also to turn the wrist. If the biceps’ job is to turn the wrist, I wondered why I shouldn’t make it more difficult to turn the dumbbell. So I made one side of my dumbbells heavier, throwing them out of balance, and instantly I could feel what it did for my biceps.

 - loc 1140 - The most important thing is that my mind was always in touch with my body; I felt my muscles continuously; I always took an inventory before working out. I flexed my muscles and got in touch. That not only helped me train; it was like meditating. I locked my mind into my muscle during training, as if I’d transplanted my mind into the tissue itself. By just thinking about it, I could actually send blood into a muscle. I formalized it by regularly making an inventory. How does my body feel now? I would ask myself. How does my chest feel? What did I get out of this press behind the neck, doing ten repetitions instead of five repetitions? How are my triceps? It doesn’t do any good to go through training like a blind man, to just go through the motions. Motions mean nothing. You have to realize what is happening to you.

 - loc 1150 - It became part of my routine that year to start out every day with total concentration. The way I did it was to play out exactly what I was going to use, how I was going to pull my muscles, and how I would feel it. I programmed myself. I saw myself doing it; I imagined how I would feel it.

 - loc 1163 - I questioned myself: Why you, Arnold? How did you win Mr. Universe after only five years of training? Other people asked me the same question. I began looking at the difference between me and other bodybuilders. The biggest difference was that most bodybuilders did not think I’m going to be a winner. They never allowed themselves to think in those terms. I would hear them complaining while they were training, “Oh, no, not another set!” The negative impulses around a gym can be incredible.

 - loc 1179 - If a man stands there and thinks for one-tenth of a second, “Maybe I can’t lift it,” it’s gone. He will not make the lift. Proof of my point is that for years weight lifters could not lift more than 500 pounds. Nobody could. They did 4991/2 but never 500. The reason was this supposedly insurmountable mental barrier that had existed for years. They stood in front of the weight thinking, “No one has ever lifted 500 pounds. Why should I be the one?” Then in 1970 Alexiev of Russia lifted 501 pounds. He broke the barrier. A month after that, three or four guys lifted 500 pounds.

 - loc 1188 - If I wasn’t training or taking care of the gym, I was in class or studying. The energy and momentum around me was unbelievable. I was insatiable, unstoppable. My friends were shaking their heads. “Arnold,” they’d say, “you’re crazy. You’re going to burn yourself out. Slow down.” I laughed at them and pushed myself that much harder.

 - loc 1202 - Positive thinking can be contagious. Being surrounded by winners helps you develop into a winner.

 - loc 1381 - I taught myself discipline, the strictest kind of discipline. How to be totally in control of my body, how to control each individual muscle. I could apply that discipline to everyday life. I used it in acting, in going to school. Whenever I didn’t want to study I would just think back and remember what it took to be Mr. Universe—the sacrifice, the hard work—and I would plunge myself into studying.

 - loc 1390 - With acting, now, I am determined to work as hard on removing my accent as I was on improving my poor calves. The same with business. I’m so determined to make millions of dollars that I cannot fail. In my mind I’ve already made the millions; now it’s just a matter of going through the motions.

 - loc 1414 - There was something else there besides a diversion, a release. I actually wanted to be with her. It was an unusual experience for me. I began to explore my feelings, to see why this was happening. I would pull away and watch myself. I had taught myself always to pull back and look at whatever I was doing and make a judgment about it. I always tried to be honest. It baffled me now to see that I was enjoying something more than a physical relationship with someone. I liked it.

 - loc 1422 - She had thought I would settle down, that I would reach the top in my field and level off. But that’s a concept that has no place in my thinking. For me, life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.

 - loc 1492 - You must consider that in the beginning you are training the mind as well as the body. The mind, after all, makes you want to train; it turns on the body. Because the mind motivates you to train the body, you have to train the mind first. If the mind doesn’t want to lift weights, the body won’t lift them.

 - loc 1520 - I maintain the most important thing is to be straight in your mind, to be honest with yourself. The exercises are the easy part.

 - loc 1674 - The best time to exercise is about one hour before you eat or two hours after you have eaten a full meal. 2. Try to eat something about two hours before exercising so your energy level will be high.

 - loc 1678 - The result of exercising too soon will be poor digestion of your food. I advise never to train immediately before a meal or right after one. In either case it’s bad. You should have at least a half to three quarters of an hour for letting your body come down from exercise, and at least three quarters of an hour to an hour for digestion.

 - loc 1706 - Remember that one rule: as soon as there is any strain on your body you should breathe out. The time to inhale is when you let yourself down, when your body is under the least amount of pressure.

 - loc 1721 - Inhale as you lower your body to the floor, allowing only your chest to touch. Your stomach should still be an inch or two off the floor when you touch with your chest, because your toes lift the body up a bit.

 - loc 1742 - This is a triceps and pectoral and deltoid exercise. Some people lean forward too much so it becomes a strict pectoral exercise, which you’ve had with push-ups. It should be fifty percent in the triceps, forty percent in the deltoids and ten percent in the shoulders.

 - loc 1750 - I’m going to repeat that idea over and over throughout this book: Doing exercises correctly, perfectly, doing full movements, is the most important thing in bodybuilding.

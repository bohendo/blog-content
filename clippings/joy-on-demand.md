#  Joy on Demand
## by Chade-Meng Tan

 - loc 230 - Mindfulness is defined as “paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.”

 - loc 280 - These days, I recently realized, I almost never lose my sense of humor anymore. Archbishop Desmond Tutu once said, “If you want to become an agent of change, you have to remember to keep your sense of humor.”

 - loc 287 - There was a man who had a skin condition that made his skin itch all the time. Every time he scratched his itch, he felt good. Then one day, a skillful doctor cured him of his skin condition, and he didn’t have to scratch anymore. He realized that scratching his itch had felt good, but not having to scratch an itch at all feels even better. We have a mind condition that makes us itch for two types of pleasure: pleasure of the senses and pleasure of the ego. When our senses are pleasantly stimulated, as when we eat something tasty, or our ego is pleasantly stimulated, as when we are praised for something we did, we feel joy, which is good. What is even better is if we can feel joy independent of sense or ego pleasure.

 - loc 295 - To train the mind to access stimulus-free joy, we need to understand how joy arises independent of sensual stimulation and then cultivate those skills. They are three: easing, inclining, and uplifting.

 - loc 362 - Joy, in contrast, is a pleasurable feeling. It is an emotion. It is in the moment, while happiness is more of a net effect, over time, of mental health and fitness and personal flourishing.

 - loc 368 - Success does not lead to happiness; instead, happiness leads to success.

 - loc 383 - Since wealth is a personality multiplier, it is also an experience multiplier. If you are miserable when you are middle class, you will likely be even more miserable when you are wealthy, because all the mental states that cause you to be miserable, such as greed, cruelty, paranoia, and inner turmoil, get multiplied.

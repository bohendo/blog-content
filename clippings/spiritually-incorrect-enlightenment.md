 - loc 59 - Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick is not a book about whaling or madness or revenge, it’s a book about one thing and one thing only: Man’s pursuit of truth; truth at any price.

 - loc 59 - Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick is not a book about whaling or madness or revenge, it’s a book about one

 - loc 240 - You’ve heard the Chinese saying that’s both a blessing and a curse; May you live in interesting times. If you look at it, you’ll see that we don’t live in interesting times, but we could. That’s what your terror scenario is really about, isn’t it? The times becoming interesting? We’d have perfect seats for one of the greatest spectacles in the history of the world; the meltdown of an advanced technological civilization.

 - loc 567 - she adopted the idea that exploring and cleaning her own interior space was not so very different from venturing into an attic that has been used indiscriminately for storage for many years.  Where did all this shit come from? What a mess! I thought my mind was mine, but I come up here and find nothing but a dark, dank space stuffed to the rafters with every conceivable manner of garbage and junk!

 - loc 630 - For the sincere seeker, to be challenged is to be entertained—they are two sides of the same coin—and whatever else he may be, U. G. Krishnamurti is challenging and entertaining.

 - loc 641 - Your constant utilization of thought to give continuity to your separate self is ‘you’. There is nothing there inside you other than that.

 - loc 702 - The question is the key. Once we truly understand the question, we’ll have the desired answer. The desired answer is always the removal of the obstruction a correct question represents. The question, understood correctly, is the obstruction.

 - loc 707 - Find that one question; the exact question that ego doesn’t want you to ask. Put your full attention on it. That’s how progress is made. Everything else is a stall tactic.

 - loc 784 - Anyone taking an objective view will conclude, like Goethe, that the less deceived we think ourselves, the more we probably are. Maya’s hold over us is strongest when we think it weakest.

 - loc 784 - Anyone taking an objective view will conclude, like Goethe, that the less deceived we think ourselves, the more we probably are. Maya’s hold over us is strongest when we think it weakest. They say nobody’s perfect, and that’s a literal fact. If you want to become perfect, become nobody. They only way to get free of Maya’s grasp is if there’s nothing for her to hold onto.

 - loc 982 - keep gnawing at it I finally get to the point where I understand the question, and somehow that always seems to provide the answer. This isn’t like scientific inquiry or like solving an equation where there’s a right answer you have to find. This isn’t about answering questions or solving problems, it’s about destroying them. It’s about seeing a question or problem with perfect clarity, which makes it disappear as if it never was.

 - loc 991 - The First Step is the last step and I know I’ll never experience firm footing again – the illusion of firm footing, that is. There is no such thing as terra firma because there’s no firma, only incognita.

 - loc 1024 - America kicks spiritual ass.  I am confident in saying that the American seeker could do as well or better in his own language and in his own country than he could by searching all of the East and going back to the Buddha.

 - loc 1058 - Moby-Dick isn’t a novel and Leaves of Grass isn’t a book of poetry. Whitman and Melville weren’t mere authors or philosophers sitting at their desks wondering about the meaning of life; guessing, speculating, constructing elaborate theories. They were

 - loc 1058 - Moby-Dick isn’t a novel and Leaves of Grass isn’t a book of poetry. Whitman and Melville weren’t mere authors or philosophers sitting at their desks wondering about the meaning of life; guessing, speculating, constructing elaborate theories. They were rough-hewn, self-determined men, deeply involved with life.

 - loc 1163 - Ignorance isn’t an aspect of self; it’s the essence of self. It’s not nothing where there should be something, it’s the delicate weaving of something from nothing.

 - loc 1236 - through a death and rebirth process, the bindings of ego will start to itch and the itch will start to annoy him more and more until it’s like he’s allergic to his own skin, and at last he’ll shed his false skin and be as if born anew into a world in which he knows he belongs; in which he is not a trespasser or debtor, which is his and which is not other than him.

 - loc 1255 - Adulthood. Our true state is one of playfulness, innocence, lack of guile, unboundedness of spirit, robust health and inner light, a natural confidence and unerring sense of right, imperturbability, grace, a calm eye and easy good humor, balance, freedom from malice and pettiness, the absence of fear, the presence of largesse and a permeating sense of gratitude. Creativity. Connectedness. Correctness. This is the clear and rightful state of the human being, and to arrive at it, one must die of the flesh to be born of the spirit.

 - loc 1380 - If truth hath no confines, then all confines are false. One who dedicates himself to striking through all confines must eventually arrive at truth. Hence, further.

 - loc 1714 - Actually, most people would function a lot more smoothly and easily a lot more of the time if they’d just learn to breathe correctly. Practically everyone restricts their breathing to the upper part of the lungs, so that the chest expands and not the belly. The result of this shallow breathing is that we operate in a perpetual panic mode, as if all of life was a fight-or-flight situation.

 - loc 1800 - Truth isn’t good and delusion isn’t evil. No one is ahead or behind. The worms won’t care how your epitaph reads and the truth of you will outlive time itself. All is vanity.  All.

 - loc 1822 - The segregated self is slain and the integrated self is born. Death and resurrection, caterpillar and butterfly, human and vampire. To the onlooker it looks like one becomes the other, but to the participant it is quite unmistakably the end of one thing and the beginning of another.

 - loc 1849 - Ego may desire enlightenment, but ego can’t cross that line. The person who stands up is not the person who fell. It’s the primary death/birth process, and nothing proceeds until it happens.

 - loc 1864 - All attachments to the dreamstate are made of energy. That energy is called emotion. All emotions, positive and negative, are attachments. Humans are emotion-based creatures and all emotions derive their energy from one core emotion; fear. Fear cannot be confronted or slain because it is fear of nothing, of no-self. The desire to slay fear is itself a fear-based emotion. Fear can only be surrendered to; the thing feared, entered.

 - loc 2004 - I’m sure there are many other threads woven into this small section of the tapestry as well. Infinite intelligence means just that; as vast and incomprehensibly complex as the workings of things may appear to us, there is no such thing as big or small, simple or hard, many or few, to the perfect intelligence that governs all and is all, and I think the thing I might have failed to notice is the fact that not everyone knows this and lives their life in accordance with it.

 - loc 2014 - Dissect thoughts, words and actions to find the kernel of fear within. To know the lie is to hate it; to see it is to slay it.

 - loc 2188 - Look here, I want to experience God, truth, reality or what you will, so I must understand the nature of the experiencing structure inside of me before I deal with all that. I must look at the instrument I am using. You are trying to capture something that cannot be captured in terms of your experiencing structure, so this experiencing structure must not be there in order that the other thing may come in.

 - loc 2204 - When the experiencing structure is not manipulating consciousness (or whatever you want to call it), then the whole of life is a great big dream, from the experiential point of view – not from this point of view here; but from your point of view. You see, you give reality to things – not only to objects, but also to feelings and experiences – and think that they are real. When you don’t translate them in terms of your accumulated knowledge, they are not things; you really don’t know what they are.

 - loc 2210 - If there is a present, that present can never be experienced by you, because you experience only your knowledge about the present, and that knowledge is the past.

 - loc 2232 - “Do you mean that Herman Melville wrote Moby-Dick as, like, his version of Spiritual Autolysis?”  “Any honest writing will invariably be a process of self-immolation—autolysis—so yes. Certainly.”

 - loc 2267 - I laugh. Govinda remains silent. I see that this discussion is having more impact on Govinda than Curtis. Govinda is the one who wants to know what it means to set a course that will take him beyond the edge of the charts. For Curtis, this is just a postcard from a place he’s heard about. For Govinda, it’s a glimpse into what he considers a possible future.

 - loc 2420 - The process of awakening looks like it’s about destroying ego, but that’s not really accurate. You never completely rid yourself of ego—the false self—as long as you’re alive, and it’s not important that you do. What matters is the emotional tethers that anchor us to the dreamstate; that hold us in place and make us feel that we’re a part of something real.

 - loc 2633 - Ultimately, no answer is possible and the question itself disintegrates under scrutiny. All questions do.

 - loc 2633 - Ultimately, no answer is possible and the question itself disintegrates under scrutiny. All questions do.  Everything disintegrates under scrutiny.

 - loc 2650 - Unhappiness is when we worry about not having something, depression is when we realize we’ll never have it, and freedom is when we realize that nothing is ours and nothing can be ours, so that, in effect, nothing isn’t ours.

 - loc 2685 - I do not and cannot share the view that something is wrong and needs fixing. No matter how absolutely certain someone might be that something is wrong, and no matter how terribly wrong it may

 - loc 2685 - No matter how absolutely certain someone might be that something is wrong, and no matter how terribly wrong it may appear, I am absolutely, unshakably certain that it’s not. I am incapable of perceiving error. I reside in a perfect universe where nothing can ever be wrong. We all do, I just happen to know it.

 - loc 2696 - You, the reader, are at the exact center of the universe; your universe. It’s all yours, it’s all about you, and you are all alone in it. Anything that tells you otherwise is a belief, and no belief is true.

 - loc 2941 - Ego is a bird’s nest, haphazardly collected and carelessly placed, shaped by every bit of debris and every breeze that has ever passed its way.

 - loc 2944 - You can try to take control of your self, try to make some sense of it, organize it, but all you can really do is tidy up on the surface. Some egos are more cluttered, some less, but the idea that a true self lurks within the clutter is just one of the little vanities that keeps us walking in small, purposeful circles. There’s no such thing as true self.

Some egos are more cluttered, some less, but the idea that a true self lurks within the clutter is just one of the little vanities that keeps us walking in small, purposeful circles. There’s no such thing as true self.  Realizing that you have no idea who you are is the beginning of finding out who you are. The idea of the individual self, valid and separate, unravels very quickly under any serious scrutiny. All beliefs do. What takes time and effort is becoming the person who chooses to put the idea of self under such scrutiny, and making sense of what’s left after the belief is gone.

 - loc 2961 - “Oh, there are my career ambitions. They were such a big part of me, so important. Funny I didn’t notice them missing. Now I can’t even remember what they really were or why I really had them. I can’t even imagine having such a thing as a career ambition now.”

 - loc 3025 - It’s not bottomless, I know it’s not, but knowing rationally isn’t the same as knowing knowing.

 - loc 3072 - What prevents you from understanding what you want to understand is this very thing which you are using to understand things. This is not my teaching or anybody’s teaching, but this is the only thing: You are trying to understand something through an instrument which is not the instrument to understand.

 - loc 3571 - The entirety of mankind’s science can be summarily discarded by anyone who understands the First Law of Objective Reality which states: There Ain’t None.

 - loc 3848 - Stillness and silence are the antithesis of the awakening process, and those who advocate peace and compassion and a quiet mind are just reselling their preferred sleep potions.

 - loc 3897 - I have no rules. Rules are a way we have of defining ourselves, of drawing imaginary boundaries. Such boundaries are artificial and easily erased.

 - loc 3897 - I have no rules. Rules are a way we have of defining ourselves, of drawing imaginary boundaries. Such boundaries are artificial and easily erased. Our most strongly held convictions can be wiped away like a layer of make-up through a moment of transcendence or cataclysm, or merely by a slight shift in brain chemistry. Morals, ethics, I have none. As it happens, I’m a nice guy. If it happens another way, I’ll be another kind of guy. I could make the impassioned assertion that I’d never, under any circumstances, cause anyone harm, but events might change and for some reason I’ll have to push some kids in front of a train this afternoon.

 - loc 3899 - of transcendence or cataclysm, or merely by a slight shift in brain chemistry. Morals, ethics, I have none.

 - loc 3908 - No, I don’t really think that the universe will have me push children in front of a train this afternoon. That lets me off the hook, but not the children. The universe probably won’t use my hands for it, but it will still push those children in front of that train.

 - loc 4103 - Being socially inept, my usual response to situations like this is to do what I like and let people be offended if they want. In this case, that means I leave, which I start to do when Jolene speaks up.

 - loc 4320 - The battle that is brewing within her won’t be between the little bastard and Jolene, as it may appear, but between the little bastard and Maya. Maya, on this battlefield, will be represented by fear, and the little bastard by hate. Fear vs Hate. Fear of No-Self vs Hatred of False-Self. These are the armies facing each other on the fields of Kurukshetra.

 - loc 4361 - Freedom isn’t a thing itself, it’s an incomplete idea. You have to be free from something. What do you want to be free from?”

#  Spiritual Enlightenment: The Damnedest Thing

## by Jed McKenna

 - loc 109 - What are you doing? Why are you doing it? Where is this going? If you know, you’ll succeed. If you don’t, you won’t. That’s not just pretty talk, that’s the law.

 - loc 121 - “Enlightenment is truth-realization. Not only is truth simple, it’s that which cannot be simpler; cannot be further reduced.”

 - loc 168 - Alexander Pope wrote, “One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.” Wrongness is in the eye of the beholder and nowhere else.

 - loc 168 - As Alexander Pope wrote, “One truth is clear, whatever is, is right.” Wrongness is in the eye of the beholder and nowhere else.

 - loc 179 - The fear of no-self is the mother of all fears, the one upon which all others are based. No

 - loc 179 - The fear of no-self is the mother of all fears, the one upon which all others are based. No fear is so small or petty that the fear of no-self isn’t at its heart.

 - loc 179 - The fear of no-self is the mother of all fears, the one upon which all others are based. No fear is so small or petty that the fear of no-self isn’t at its heart. All fear is ultimately fear of no-self. “And what is enlightenment,” I ask Sarah, “but a swan dive into the abyss of no-self?”

 - loc 368 - The power of our devotion to teachers and teachings is not a reflection of their value, but of ego’s will to survive. It’s ego—the false self—that exalts the guru and declares the teaching sacred, but nothing is exalted or sacred, only true or not true.

 - loc 371 - there’s really only one real cult—the Cult of False Self—and everyone is a fanatically devoted member. Awakening is the process of deprogramming. Enlightenment is the unprogrammed state.

 - loc 532 - Enlightenment is about truth. It’s not about becoming a better or happier person. It’s not about personal growth or spiritual evolution.

 - loc 586 - As history shows, the fastest way to reduce otherwise decent people to a state of savagery is by tampering with their belief system. The word for someone who does so is heretic, and historically the punishments reserved for him are more brutal than for any other class of offender.

 - loc 611 - An easy way to distinguish between caterpillars and butterflies is to remember that the enlightened don’t attach importance to anything, and that enlightenment doesn’t require knowledge. It’s not about love or compassion or consciousness. It’s about truth.

 - loc 641 - All fear is ultimately fear of this inner black hole, and nothing on this side of that hole is true. The process of achieving enlightenment is about breaking through the blockage and stepping through the hole, and anything that’s not about getting to and through the hole is just more rubbish and debris.

 - loc 664 - The price of truth is everything. Everything. That’s the rule and it’s inviolable.”

 - loc 724 - “You’re welcome. The process of Spiritual Autolysis is basically like a Zen koan on steroids. All you really have to do is write the truth.”

 - loc 736 - Write and rewrite. Make it cleaner and cut out the excess and ego and follow it wherever it leads until you’re done.”

 - loc 773 - Intellect is used as the sword with which ego commits a slow and agonizing suicide; the death of a thousand cuts.

 - loc 805 - Use the process of Spiritual Autolysis as a means of expressing your own highest knowledge for someone else’s benefit. And, of course, keep improving it until you’ve stated the truth.” “Which I’ll never do?” “What, state the truth? No, of course not.”

 - loc 818 - The realization was nothing more or less than this: Truth exists.

 - loc 847 - Jed McKenna is like the outfit an invisible man wears so that he can interact with people without freaking them out.

 - loc 870 - I may be doing this or that—fulfilling my role—but I’m almost always out in the seats somewhere, watching it all, as unprepared for the next thing I do as anyone else.

 - loc 951 - If you want to be an enlightened person, the thinking goes, you should act like an enlightened person. Utter nonsense, of course, but widely accepted. Once you’re able to recognize this fallacy, you’ll be amazed by how common it is.

 - loc 963 - Well, I’ve noticed that every time I eat a good meal, I belch, so I tell you to belch because that means you’re well fed. Totally backward, right? You’re still starving, and now you’re also offgassing like a pig. And the worst part of the whole deal—pay attention to this trick—the worst part is that you’ve stopped looking for food. You are now programmed to fail; your starvation is assured.”

 - loc 1497 - Julie seems to have that ability to relax into the moment and let the universe do the driving. If there was a secret to happiness in life, I’d say that was it.

 - loc 1577 - Here’s all you need to know to become enlightened: Sit down, shut up, and ask yourself what’s true until you know.

 - loc 1851 - “No belief is true. No. Belief. Is. True.” I just leave it hanging out there for a while, letting it imprint itself on these minds so that they’ll be able to revisit it and confirm it for themselves later.

 - loc 2288 - Don’t, however, rely on your current definition of fear and look for that. You won’t find it. Loosen up. Bring your A game. Observe, think, dissect, detect patterns. Watch for motivations, then find the motivation beneath the motivation. Abandon your assumptions and approach it from the other direction; not from within but from without, not from the micro but from the macro. Even from men and women who are successful, calm, poised, and self-possessed, fear exudes like a noxious stink.

 - loc 2296 - Do you want to awaken? To stop being a false, artificial, self-benighted being? Then developing and sharpening this sense—the ability to detect fear and the source and emanations of fear—amounts to nothing more than disengaging your own autoimmune system; the subsystem of ego that keeps this poison from making you sick. Yes, to get it out you must let it in, breathe it deep, and allow yourself to become sickened by it. The way out is through, and there can be no rebirth without first a death.

 - loc 2368 - The forest of delusion is treed with concepts, and ultimately, all concepts mean the same thing; you’re still in the forest

 - loc 2773 - The deepest truth of any person is no-person. One may insist otherwise with every thought and feeling, but that doesn’t change the truth. It’s not fear of death that drives humans, it’s fear of non-being. Oblivion.”

 - loc 2871 - The caterpillar doesn’t become a butterfly, it enters a death process that becomes the birth process of the butterfly. The appearance of transformation is an illusion. One thing doesn’t become another thing. One thing ends and another begins

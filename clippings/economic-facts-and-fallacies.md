#  Economic Facts and Fallacies

## by Thomas Sowell

 - loc 69 - Sometimes what is missing in a fallacy is simply a definition. Undefined words have a special power in politics, particularly when they invoke some principle that engages people’s emotions.

 - loc 94 - These five widespread kinds of fallacies may be called the zero-sum fallacy, the fallacy of composition, the post hoc fallacy, the chess-pieces fallacy, and the open-ended fallacy.

 - loc 161 - What logicians call “the fallacy of composition” is the belief that what is true of a part is true of the whole.

 - loc 189 - One of the most common fallacies is so old that it has a Latin name from centuries ago: Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc—in other words, “After this, therefore because of this.”

 - loc 241 - Open-ended demands are a mandate for ever-expanding government bureaucracies with ever-expanding budgets and powers.

 - loc 415 - When Houston, for example, added a hundred miles a year to its road network from 1986 to 1992, average delay per traveler at the rush hour peaks declined 21 percent. But, when Houston drastically cut back on road building between 1993 and 2000, while its population was still growing, travel delays nearly doubled.

 - loc 420 - In other words, building more roadways to keep pace with the growth of traffic only works when you do it. So do most things.

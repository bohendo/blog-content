 - loc 213 - Mining rapidly converges on 1 BTC costing 1 BTC

 - loc 213 - Mining rapidly converges on 1 BTC costing 1 BTC to generate.

 - loc 580 - As a financial instrument born without regulation, Bitcoin quickly turned into an iterative exploration of precisely why each financial regulation exists.

 - loc 609 - Biased “provably fair” gambling: “Provably fair” gambling sites generate their random numbers in advance then send you a cryptographic hash of the sequence of numbers, so you don’t know the numbers ahead of time but you can verify the hash afterwards.64 Some sites, if you don’t grab the hash, then use a biased sequence of numbers instead.

 - loc 673 - Most were computer programmers whose approach to anything outside their field was “I know PHP, how hard could running an exchange be?” As Dunning and Kruger pointed out in 1999,79 this approach tends not to work out so well.

 - loc 793 - McCaleb went on to develop the cryptocurrencies Ripple and Stellar; his LinkedIn page107 details his career back to eDonkey, but chooses to omit Mt. Gox.

 - loc 849 - The laptop contained the near-complete collection of smoking gun evidence on the Silk Road, gift-wrapped with a little bow on top. It included the list of Silk Road servers and the names Ulbricht had used to rent them, the Silk Road accounting spreadsheets (including the purchase of the laptop), on-site chat logs, the PHP code for the site itself, photo ID for other Silk Road administrators, all the encryption keys for the site, 144,000 bitcoins … and log.txt, Ulbricht’s daily diary of his Silk Road activities: building the site, dealing with business issues, ordering hits on people.116 “I imagine that someday I may have a story written about my life, and it would be good

 - loc 1347 - WhollyHemp ended up making 0.2% of sales in Bitcoin, and an A/B test showed that prominent mention of Bitcoin acceptance reduced gross sales by 5.8%.230 They removed the Bitcoin option altogether in April 2015, and were harassed by Bitcoin advocates231 for the next several months.232 Lestak: “This is why you don’t hear about businesses publicly dropping Bitcoin as a payment option. Bitcoiners will make your life a living hell if you do.”

 - loc 1366 - Steve Early is a Cambridge computer scientist and beer enthusiast turned publican. He writes all his own till software and control systems for the pubs. (The only pub chain ever to get a six-page writeup in a Linux magazine.237) When he said in mid-2013 that he was thinking

 - loc 1366 - Steve Early is a Cambridge computer scientist and beer enthusiast turned publican. He writes all his own till software and control systems for the pubs. (The only pub chain ever to get a six-page writeup in a Linux magazine.237) When he said in mid-2013 that he was thinking about Bitcoin, I considered he was the one person I knew who was most likely to do well out of it. The pub corporation sells the coins to Steve at the BitPay rate for that day, Steve sells them at his leisure. It was actually easier to process bitcoins than cards: “I was so frustrated, and still am, with the inability to integrate card payments with the tills. This seems to be a uniquely UK thing – the banks own the terminals. You always have to rent them from the bank or a reseller. They configure the terminal, you don’t get an API to it. This is why Britain was able to go chip-and-PIN so quickly – the banks could just replace the terminals without having to convince the merchants.

 - loc 1370 - “I was so frustrated, and still am, with the inability to integrate card payments with the tills. This seems to be a uniquely UK thing – the banks own the terminals.

This is why Britain was able to go chip-and-PIN so quickly – the banks could just replace the terminals without having to convince the merchants. “In June 2013, I was relief-managing our pub in Norwich and I was bored. Adding Bitcoin to the tills was two evenings of hacking. There were a couple of weeks of testing and refinement, and it’s basically been untouched since then, except when an interface changes.238 I did it to scratch the itch, not for publicity or profit. “Takings stayed high for about nine months, about £1000 a month out of a couple of hundred thousand across the chain. Currently it’s about £200 a month, which I suspect represents two or three customers. Since I’ve started, I’ve taken about £17,000 worth. “I am accepting Bitcoin in the most naive manner possible, accepting zero-confirmation transactions.” (Where you can see someone’s tried a transaction, but it hasn’t made it into a block yet; vulnerable to fraudulent customers double-spending.) “Which is pretty much the only way it can work in a pub setting. Zero confirmation has worked out so far. There’s been one occasion where a transaction wasn’t confirmed. “The transaction backlog getting bigger and bigger as the block size stays the same is going to be a problem. A hundred percent of your customers can be honest, and you can still lose out because your transactions are dropped. When too many are dropped, that’s when I’ll have to push the off switch. I have probably more than recovered that from people accidentally paying twice because we didn’t think the transaction went through the first time. For comparison, we take about fifty quid of bogus

 - loc 1699 - There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge. – Hunter S. Thompson, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas

 - loc 1706 - An ICO makes sense for crowdfunding in very limited conditions – if you have a technical problem that requires decentralised, cryptographically verified tokens (if it doesn’t need tokens, they shouldn’t be bolted on); if the tokens are directly usable on the platform itself; if at least a proof-of-concept of the technology verifiably exists. It also helps if the idea is even plausible as a business. Unsurprisingly, most ICOs don’t meet these criteria.

 - loc 1747 - The legal EOS Token Purchase Agreement is a frankly amazing document that everyone should read.

 - loc 1747 - The legal EOS Token Purchase Agreement is a frankly amazing document that everyone should read.319 US citizens or residents are not to buy the tokens (though EOS assures us they totally don’t constitute a security – hear that, SEC?); the tokens are defined as not being useful in any manner whatsoever; forty-eight hours after the end of the distribution period, the tokens will no longer be transferable; the buyer promises not to purchase them for speculation or investment. If there’s any legal problems caused by you buying these officially worthless things, you agree to indemnify EOS. Crypto fans still lined up to buy them.

 - loc 1796 - There are five groups of people who want smart contracts: Computer programmers who don’t have an aptitude for social or legal conventions, but do have an aptitude for programming, so they’d like social and legal conventions to work a bit more like that. Anarcho-capitalists who want to replace the government with a small DOS batch file. (Particularly ones who are also in the first group.)

 - loc 1825 - The purpose of law is not to achieve philosophical or mathematical truth, but to take a messy reality and achieve workable results that society can live with.

 - loc 1830 - In software testing, an oracle is any mechanism that determines if a test has passed or failed. The oracle problem is how to do this without costly human intervention. This usage was adopted for smart contracts, where the oracle problem is to determine whether a real-world condition in a smart contract has been met.

 - loc 1838 - “My immutable unforgeable cryptographically secure blockchain record proving that I have 10,000 pounds of aluminum in a warehouse is not much use to a bank if I then smuggle the aluminum out of the warehouse through the back door.”

 - loc 1845 - If your question isn’t popular enough to attract sufficient uninvolved wagers – it would often be worth it for one party to just bribe the bettors – you will still have the oracle problem in determining whether the event has in fact occurred. You can’t get rid of the human element by adding another layer of indirection – it’s oracles all the way down.

 - loc 1847 - element by adding another layer of indirection – it’s oracles all the way down. (Augur has openly bragged that they think running on a blockchain means they can dodge US government regulation on gambling and derivatives, which led to the shutdown of previous prediction markets,

 - loc 1861 - The eventual fix for The DAO hack demonstrates the other problem with smart contracts: the “immutable” system containing the smart contract was suddenly considered changeable the moment the big boys risked losing enough money.

 - loc 1869 - A much-touted advantage of smart contracts is that the code is public, so anyone can check and verify it before engaging with it. The problem is that it is extremely difficult to tell precisely what a program might possibly do without actually running it.339

 - loc 1897 - Solidity, is a procedural language based on the web programming language JavaScript – to make it as easy as possible for beginners to write their first smart contract. It contains many constructs that mislead programmers coming from JavaScript into shooting themselves in the foot.345 It is ill-suited and hazardous for concurrency (e.g., the Solarstorm vulnerability346), despite this being a specific intended use case.

 - loc 1909 - The casino whose pseudorandom number generator had the random seed in the code, so anyone could recreate the precise sequence of random numbers.349 The GovernMental Ponzi was going to pay out 1100 ETH, but due to a coding error this required more gas than the maximum possible gas for a transaction. The ether is now stuck there forever.350 Many schemes which ran out of gas due to bugs, e.g., King of the Ether.351 Rubixi Ponzi: Errors in the code, copy-and-pasted from other contracts, allowed anyone to become the owner and take the money.352 A Ponzi which would pay out only to the creator of the scheme because of what looked to casual inspection of the code like a typo in a variable name.353 No doubt just an accident, I’m sure.

 - loc 1922 - You just learned chemistry and the first thing you built was a giant bomb and you can’t understand why it blew up in your face. – brockchainbrockshize, /r/ethereum

 - loc 1946 - Stephen Tual of Slock.it confidently declaring on 12 June “No DAO funds at risk following the Ethereum smart contract ‘recursive call’ bug discovery”358 … and on 17 June, a hacker used this recursive call bug to drain $50 million from The DAO. And nobody could stop this happening, because the smart contract code couldn’t be altered without two weeks’ consensus from participants.

 - loc 1964 - The DAO was shut down soon after, and on 20 July the Ethereum Foundation – several of whose principals were curators of The DAO362 and/or heavily invested in it – changed how the actual code of Ethereum interpreted their blockchain (the “immutable” ledger) so as to wind back the hack and take back their money. The blockchain was “immutable,” so they changed how it was interpreted. The “impossible” bailout had happened.

The blockchain was “immutable,” so they changed how it was interpreted. The “impossible” bailout had happened. This illustrated the final major problem with smart contracts: CODE IS LAW until the whales are in danger of losing money.

 - loc 1988 - But by late 2015, “Blockchain” hype had taken on a life of its own as a business buzzword. If in a manner somewhat uncomfortable with its Bitcoin origins. This has been further euphemised to “distributed ledger technology,” which would on the face of it include shared Excel spreadsheets.

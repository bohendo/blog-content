 - loc 2154 - When Maxine shows Tom a unit test that reproduces the problem 100% of the time, as well as the completely thread-safe fix that now works 100% of the time, Tom stares at her, eyes wide with wonder. “That’s … that’s … incredible.” She knows why he’s impressed. Her code is so simple that it’s easy to understand and test for correctness. Eventually, marveling at the screen, he says, “I just can’t believe how much you simplified it. How can that achieve the same thing as the complex mess that we had before?”

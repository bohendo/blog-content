 - loc 303 - one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work.

 - loc 368 - Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them (Fig. 2.1). This is true of reaping wheat or picking cotton; it is not even approximately true of systems programming.

 - loc 382 - The added burden of communication is made up of two parts, training and intercommunication. Each worker must be trained in the technology, the goals of the effort, the overall strategy, and the plan of work. This training cannot be partitioned, so this part of the added effort varies linearly with the number of workers.[1] Intercommunication is worse. If each part of the task must be separately coordinated with each other part, the effort increases as n(nâ€“1)/2. Three workers require three times as much pairwise intercommunication as two; four require six times as much as two. If, moreover, there need to be conferences among three, four, etc., workers to resolve things jointly, matters get worse yet.

 - loc 397 - For some years I have been successfully using the following rule of thumb for scheduling a software task: 1/3 planning1/6 coding1/4 component test and early system test1/4 system test, all components in hand.

 - loc 407 - Failure to allow enough time for system test, in particular, is peculiarly disastrous. Since the delay comes at the end of the schedule, no one is aware of schedule trouble until almost the delivery date. Bad news, late and without warning, is unsettling to customers and to managers.

 - loc 506 - Mills proposes that each segment of a large job be tackled by a team, but that the team be organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him every support that will enhance his effectiveness and productivity.

 - loc 533 - Absolutely vital to Mills's concept is the transformation of programming "from private art to public practice" by making all the computer runs visible to all team members and identifying all programs and data as team property, not private property.

 - loc 697 - The opportunity to be creative and inventive in implementation is not significantly diminished by working within a given external specification, and the order of creativity may even be enhanced by that discipline.

 - loc 751 - The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first one.

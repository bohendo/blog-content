#  Becoming a Supple Leopard

## by Kelly Starrett

 - loc 267 - “Make your combat stance your everyday stance.” It is strange yet perfect advice from Musashi’s famous text, The Book of Five Rings.

 - loc 300 - Unlike a human, a leopard doesn’t need to prepare for movement. It doesn’t need to warm up; it doesn’t have to foam-roll; it doesn’t have to raise its core temperature—it’s just ready. Its full physical capacity is available at all times.

 - loc 854 - Whether you’re at work, chatting with a friend at the gym, or standing at attention, the basic setup is always the same: feet straight, back flat, belly tight, head neutral, and shoulders externally rotated in a stable position.

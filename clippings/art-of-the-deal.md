#  Art of the Deal
## by Donald Trump
---

 - loc 643 - One of the keys to thinking big is total focus. I think of it almost as a controlled neurosis, which is a quality I’ve noticed in many highly successful entrepreneurs. They’re obsessive, they’re driven, they’re single-minded and sometimes they’re almost maniacal, but it’s all channeled into their work. Where other people are paralyzed by neurosis, the people I’m talking about are actually helped by it. I don’t say this trait leads to a happier life, or a better life, but it’s great when it comes to getting what you want.

 - loc 652 - I always go into the deal anticipating the worst. If you plan for the worst—if you can live with the worst—the good will always take care of itself.

 - loc 670 - I also protect myself by being flexible. I never get too attached to one deal or one approach. For starters, I keep a lot of balls in the air, because most deals fall out, no matter how promising they seem at first. In addition, once I’ve made a deal, I always come up with at least a half dozen approaches to making it work, because anything can happen, even to the best-laid plans.

 - loc 677 - My original proposal was to build middle-income housing on the site, with government financing. Unfortunately, the city began to have financial problems, and money for public housing suddenly dried up. I didn’t spend a lot of time feeling sorry for myself. Instead, I switched to my second option and began promoting the site as ideal for a convention center. It took two years of pushing and promoting, but ultimately the city did designate my site for the convention center—and that’s where it was built. Of course, if they hadn’t chosen my site, I would have come up with a third approach.

 - loc 689 - If I’m thinking of buying a piece of property, I’ll ask the people who live nearby about the area—what they think of the schools and the crime and the shops. When I’m in another city and I take a cab, I’ll always make it a point to ask the cabdriver questions. I ask and I ask and I ask, until I begin to get a gut feeling about something. And that’s when I make a decision.

 - loc 706 - The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you can have. Leverage is having something the other guy wants. Or better yet, needs. Or best of all, simply can’t do without. Unfortunately, that isn’t always the case, which is why leverage often requires imagination, and salesmanship. In other words, you have to convince the other guy it’s in his interest to make the deal.

 - loc 722 - Just as you can create leverage, you can enhance a location, through promotion and through psychology.

 - loc 727 - Location also has a lot to do with fashion. You can take a mediocre location and turn it into something considerably better just by attracting the right people.

 - loc 739 - One thing I’ve learned about the press is that they’re always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better. It’s in the nature of the job, and I understand that. The point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you.

 - loc 754 - The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground.

 - loc 816 - Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.

 - loc 832 - Construction always interested him, and during high school he began taking night classes in carpentry, plan-reading, and estimating, figuring that if he learned a trade, he’d always be able to make a living. By the age of sixteen, he’d built his first structure, a two-car frame garage for a neighbor. Middle-class people were just beginning to buy cars, few homes had attached garages, and my father was soon able to establish a very good new business building prefabricated garages for fifty dollars apiece.

 - loc 840 - In addition, my father was always very focused and very ambitious. Most of his co-workers were happy just to have a job. My father not only wanted to work, he also wanted to do well and to get ahead. Finally, my father just plain loved working.

 - loc 926 - One advantage my father had was that he knew what everything cost. No one could put anything over on him.

 - loc 926 - One advantage my father had was that he knew what everything cost. No one could put anything over on him. If you know, for example, that a plumbing job is going to cost the contractor $400,000, then you know how far you can push the guy.

 - loc 934 - If a guy wasn’t doing his job the way my father thought it should be done—and I mean any job, because he could do them all—he’d jump in and take over.

 - loc 958 - Perhaps the most important thing I learned at Wharton was not to be overly impressed by academic credentials.

 - loc 994 - IN COLLEGE while my friends were reading the comics and the sports pages of newspapers, I was reading the listings of FHA foreclosures.

 - loc 994 - IN COLLEGE while my friends were reading the comics and the sports pages of newspapers, I was reading the listings of FHA foreclosures. It might seem a bit abnormal to study lists of federally financed housing projects in foreclosure, but that’s what I did. And that’s how I found out about Swifton Village. It was a job that I bought with my father, while I was in college, and it was my first big deal.

 - loc 1026 - I’ve always had a personal thing about cleanliness, but I also believe it’s a very good investment. For example, if you want to sell a car and you spend five dollars to wash and polish it and then apply a little extra elbow grease, suddenly you find you can charge an extra four hundred dollars—and get it. I can always tell a loser when I see someone with a car for sale that is filthy dirty.

 - loc 1139 - One of the first things I did was join Le Club, which at the time was the hottest club in the city and perhaps the most exclusive—like Studio 54 at its height. It was located on East 54th Street, and its membership included some of the most successful men and the most beautiful women in the world. It was the sort of place where you were likely to see a wealthy seventy-five-year-old guy walk in with three blondes from Sweden. I’ll never forget how I became a member. One day I called up Le Club and I said, “My name is Donald Trump and I’d like to join your club.” The guy on the other end of the phone just laughed and said, “You’ve got to be kidding.” Nobody, of course, had heard of me. The next day I got another idea, and I called back and I said to the guy, “Listen, could I have a list of your members? I may know someone who is a member.” And he said, “I’m sorry, we don’t do that,” and he hung up. The next day I called again and said, “I need to reach the president of the club. I want to send him something.” For some reason, the guy gave me the president’s name and his business number, and I called him up. I introduced myself. I said, very politely, “My name is Donald Trump, and I’d like to join Le Club.” And he said, “Do you have any friends or family in the club?” and I said, “No, I don’t know anybody there.” He said, “Well, what makes you think you should be admitted as a member?” I just kept talking and talking, and finally this fellow said to me, “I’ll tell you what, you sound like a nice young man, and maybe it would be good to have some younger members, so why don’t you meet me for a drink at Twenty-one?”

 - loc 1158 - This was a totally different world. I remember wondering if every successful person in Manhattan was a big drinker. I figured it that was the case, I was going to have a big advantage.

 - loc 1172 - I had a good time when I went out at night, but I was also working. I was learning how the New York scene operates and I was meeting the sort of people with whom I’d eventually work on deals.

 - loc 1258 - We had no formal name for the company when I met Victor, so I began to call it the Trump Organization. Somehow the word “organization” made it sound much bigger. Few people knew that the Trump Organization operated out of a couple of tiny offices on Avenue Z in Brooklyn.

 - loc 1296 - I’m the first to admit that I am very competitive and that I’ll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win. Sometimes, part of making a deal is denigrating your competition. In this case, I happened to genuinely believe that the Starrett bid wasn’t legitimate, that the company would never close the deal and would not be able to successfully develop the site even if the deal did go through. The fact is that anyone can bid anything, particularly when there are all sorts of contingencies.

 - loc 1327 - I announced, before a ton of reporters, that I could build my convention center for $110 million—or at least $150 million less than the city had estimated it would cost to build at West 44th Street. Not surprisingly, that raised some eyebrows and even got us some attention in the press. But there was scarcely an approving peep from the politicians. I discovered, for the first time but not the last, that politicians don’t care too much what things cost. It’s not their money.

 - loc 1490 - Suddenly it dawned on me why my deals kept coming apart: if you’re going to make a deal of any significance, you have to go to the top.

 - loc 1642 - The guy went so far out of his way to solicit our opinions and involve us in the hotel that finally I said, “Leave me alone, do whatever you want, just don’t bother me.” What he did was the perfect ploy, because he got what he wanted not by fighting but by being positive and friendly and solicitous.

 - loc 2002 - The person I hired to be my personal representative overseeing the construction, Barbara Res, was the first woman ever put in charge of a skyscraper in New York. She was thirty-three at the time, she’d worked for HRH, and I’d met her on the Commodore job, where she’d worked as a mechanical superintendent. I’d watched her in construction meetings, and what I liked was that she took no guff from anyone. She was half the size of most of these bruising guys, but she wasn’t afraid to tell them off when she had to, and she knew how to get things done.

 - loc 2006 - It’s funny. My own mother was a housewife all her life. And yet it’s turned out that I’ve hired a lot of women for top jobs, and they’ve been among my best people. Often, in fact, they are far more effective than the men around them.

 - loc 2032 - Ironically, the whole controversy may have ended up being a plus for me in terms of selling Trump Tower. The stories that appeared about it invariably started with sentences like: “In order to make way for one of the world’s most luxurious buildings …”

 - loc 2032 - Ironically, the whole controversy may have ended up being a plus for me in terms of selling Trump Tower. The stories that appeared about it invariably started with sentences like: “In order to make way for one of the world’s most luxurious buildings …” Even though the publicity was almost entirely negative, there was a great deal of it, and that drew a tremendous amount of attention to Trump Tower. Almost immediately we saw an upsurge in the sales of apartments. I’m not saying that’s a good thing, and in truth it probably says something perverse about the culture we live in. But I’m a businessman, and I learned a lesson from that experience: good publicity is preferable to bad, but from a bottom-line perspective, bad publicity is sometimes better than no publicity at all. Controversy, in short, sells.

 - loc 2161 - I had plenty of space in my triplex, but I figured, What the hell? Why shouldn’t I have exactly the apartment I wanted—particularly when I built the whole building? I decided to take over one of the other apartments on the top three floors and combine it with mine. It has taken almost two years to renovate, but I don’t believe there is any apartment anywhere in the world that can touch it. And while I can’t honestly say I need an eighty-foot living room, I do get a kick out of having one.

 - loc 2392 - Suddenly, a city that had been very hot for several years turned very cold, literally and figuratively. No one was talking about building any more new casinos. It seemed possible that the gaming business in Atlantic City was going to prove to be seasonal at best—enough to sustain only a few casinos. In my view, however, that translated into an opportunity. The worst of times often create the best opportunities to make good deals.

 - loc 2456 - In every previous situation, companies who purchased or assembled sites in Atlantic City had begun the licensing process and construction concurrently. Licensing could take as long as construction, and the sooner the casino got built, the faster it could start earning money. It’s perfectly logical—so long as your licensing comes through in the end. But unlike these other companies, I didn’t want to put several hundred million dollars at risk in the meantime. Also, I didn’t want to be in a weak negotiating position with the Casino Control Commission. Once you’ve begun investing huge sums of money, it’s very hard to say no to anything they ask for.

 - loc 2499 - With so many regulators and regulations to satisfy, we had one major advantage: the fact that we are not a bureaucracy. In most large public corporations, getting an answer to a question requires going through seven layers of executives, most of whom are superfluous in the first place. In our organization, anyone with a question could bring it directly to me and get an answer immediately. That’s precisely why I’ve been able to act so much faster than my competitors on so many deals.

 - loc 2563 - It was the latter that worried me, since we had yet to do much work on the site. One week before the board meeting, I got an idea. I called in my construction supervisor and told him that I wanted him to round up every bulldozer and dump truck he could possibly find, and put them to work on my site immediately. Over the next week, I said, I wanted him to transform my two acres of nearly vacant property into the most active construction site in the history of the world. What the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn’t important, I said, so long as they did a lot of it. If they got some actual work accomplished, all the better, but if necessary, he should have the bulldozers dig up dirt from one side of the site and dump it on the other.

 - loc 2572 - There were so many pieces of machinery on this site that they could barely maneuver around each other. These distinguished corporate leaders looked on, some of them visibly awed. I’ll never forget one of them turning to me, shaking his head, and saying, “You know, it’s great when you’re a private guy, and you can just pull out all the stops.”

 - loc 2621 - My problem with bank financing, even at these lower rates, was that I’d still be required to put myself personally on the line for the money. I didn’t find that appealing.

 - loc 2626 - Interest payments on the financing came to just above $30 million a year. That was about $7 million a year more than I’d have paid for bank financing, but to me it was money well spent. By relieving me of personal financial liability, it assured I’d sleep better at night.

 - loc 3108 - It was not one of my best experiences with the media, but it taught me something. You don’t act on an impulse—even a charitable one—unless you’ve considered the downside.

 - loc 3225 - If I could help turn the team and the league around, I stood to earn back many times my initial investment. At the very least, I would have a lot of fun trying.

 - loc 3304 - To me, committees are what insecure people create in order to put off making hard decisions.

 - loc 3323 - When it comes to making a smart decision, the most distinguished planning committee working with the highest-priced consultants doesn’t hold a candle to a group of guys with a reasonable amount of common sense and their own money on the line.

 - loc 3794 - I got the yards at a great price because a bank was foreclosing on a desperate seller, because I made the deal before the property was offered for sale on the open market, and because I was one of the few developers both willing and able to pay millions of dollars a year in carrying costs for as long as it took to get the yards developed.

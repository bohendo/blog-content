## by Peter Richardson

 - loc 46 - It provides owners with complete limited-liability protection (similar to corporations) and advantageous tax status (similar to a partnership). Additionally, LLCs have another layer of protection against liabilities: they are immune from the lawsuits that will befall the owners.

 - loc 61 - The term “member” refers to an LLC’s owner. This person has “membership interests” (i.e. ownership units) that specify two things: His/her voting power regarding company-related issues The percentage of the business he/she owns You may think of membership interests as the “stocks” of an LLC.

 - loc 118 - LLCs have unique characteristics that are ideal for the real estate industry. An LLC guards your assets with complete limited-liability protection. It also minimizes your taxes through its pass-through taxation.

 - loc 154 - Forming an LLC is a great way to protect your assets. However, it’s important to point out that you don’t have to limit yourself to one LLC. As the old saying goes, don’t put all of the eggs in just one basket. Let’s assume that you only have one LLC and you placed all of your rental properties under it. If an accident happens to one of your tenants while he/she is in your property, the rest of the properties will also be in jeopardy (since they belong to the same LLC). You can prevent this problem by dividing your properties among different LLCs.

 - loc 159 - LLCs come in two different flavors: Member-managed – All of the owners manage the company. Manager-managed – Here, a manager will manage the business. The manager can be one of the owners.

 - loc 165 - Important Note: Most states require you to specify your LLC’s type of management.

 - loc 169 - You must get the services of a registered agent (also known as “RA”, “resident agent”, or “statutory agent”) before submitting the articles of organization. Basically, an RA is a company or individual that can receive legal documents on your behalf in case you get sued.

 - loc 174 - Important Note: Some states let you act as the registered agent for your business. However, this is not a great option for inexperienced LLC owners. If you are an RA, you should always be available during the business hours of each day. You also need to understand each state filing that you need to do. Thus, it would be easier if you’ll let the professionals do it.

 - loc 178 - LLCs and their owners don’t need to be in the same state. For example, you can register an LLC in California even if you live in Ohio.

 - loc 180 - If your company doesn’t need a headquarters (e.g. internet-based businesses), then you should register your LLC in the state that has the ideal tax laws.

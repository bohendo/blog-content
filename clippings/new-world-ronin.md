#  New World Ronin
## by Victor Pride
---

 - loc 61 - Destiny can be your master or your mistress as she is female and responds to strength and weakness the same way a living female responds to them.

 - loc 196 - Accept the Things You Cannot Change, Change the Things You Cannot Accept. Only the discontent can aim to become New World Ronin.

 - loc 223 - Your time as a ronin in training is what prepares you for greatness. The mission of the wandering ronin in training is to gain knowledge that is unavailable in books.

 - loc 244 - To learn how to help and lead others you must first learn how to help and lead yourself.  You must learn the ruthless self-discipline it takes to walk your own way and make your own path in life. To give orders to others you must first learn how to give orders to yourself and you must learn how to make yourself follow those orders.

 - loc 269 - We do not ponder or over-think. We develop a killer instinct because we know over-thinking is the curse of the ghost.

 - loc 307 - I learned everything by myself. I never had a teacher who cared and I never had a mentor. I never had anybody show me the way. I got my knowledge first from reading the great books, but that wasn’t enough.

 - loc 311 - Book learning is a waste without experience which is why the ronin in training must gain experience.

 - loc 325 - The way requires momentum.

 - loc 331 - You don’t start because you don’t know how to start. But you will never know how to start until you start.  It is not a catch-22 or a contradiction. You cannot know how to do something until you actually do it. The knowledge comes from moving forward, it does not come from books.

 - loc 344 - No one cares about what I want; people only care about what they want.  When I learned this rule, I found success instantly.

 - loc 361 - Always be Building! They call us serial entrepreneurs for a reason. Entrepreneurs are the new conquerors. The fun is in starting and building, not in receiving payment. The key to starting and building multiple businesses that work is very simple; focus on one business until it works. Then, shift your focus to a new venture

 - loc 373 - The fun is always in the getting, the fun is never in the gotten.

 - loc 384 - The fun is never in the celebration, the fun is in having a reason to celebrate

 - loc 395 - Hungry ghosts are cursed. They can never be satisfied and they must be ignored at all costs. Hungry ghosts are the mortal enemy of the ronin and a ronin's ears must be totally deaf to hateful critics.

 - loc 410 - Sho'Gunna Mentality as defined by Pride Zen: He who believes he has the ability to change the world, he who believes it is not only his privilege but his duty to do so and he who feels as though he cannot fail. These are the traits that produce the great shoguns. One must be manically self-confident to create greatness.

 - loc 417 - Resistance is an enemy that must be killed with extreme prejudice. Greater than the enemy of hungry ghosts is the #1 enemy that ever lived: your own self-resistance. That is why all ronin are required to be good-hearted. A good-hearted ronin deals with resistance humanely by cutting its head off quickly.

 - loc 429 - Idle time means defeat because idle time means the momentum has been broken. When the momentum is broken, the player is broken and you will have to re-start or stay broken. It is always harder to re-start than it is to just keep going.

 - loc 465 - The rules are not: get a good job, get a good wife, be a good boy and retire “rich.” Those are the rules of geishas and ghosts.  The ronin rules are the rules they call “bad.” Rules like: be selfish, be obsessed, be unbending and be unbreakable. Every great man became great the exact same way: the way of doing everything opposite of the standard advice.

 - loc 503 - If you’re awake, you’re working. No exceptions. It’s easy; all you have to do is show up

 - loc 516 - Be patient when it comes to the rewards of your work but do not be patient about doing your work.

 - loc 541 - A shogun is a ronin who knows how to delegate.

 - loc 547 - Full Color Work and B&W work are essential to the game and one must not be thought of as more important than the other. Full Color Work is the work that creates new businesses. B&W work keeps the momentum of the business always moving forward.

 - loc 643 - Buy green trees and plants for your lab. Green is calming and comforting. The plants will clean your oxygen for you, giving you a higher percentage of clean oxygen in the air your breathe.

 - loc 653 - There must be balance between sitting, standing, walking and lying down. All four positions create different thinking styles which lead to new breakthroughs in the work.

 - loc 662 - When creating Full Color Work always turn off the phone, always turn off email, always turn off any and all distraction.

 - loc 662 - When creating Full Color Work always turn off the phone, always turn off email, always turn off any and all distraction. When doing B&W work, it is fine to be interrupted. B&W work will get done whether you are mindful or not. Full Color Work, on the other hand, will never get done if you are constantly distracted.

 - loc 670 - nothing breaks the flow like eating a big meal that requires big digestion time.

 - loc 673 - One simply cannot understand how distracting the modern world is until one goes away from it and then returns.

 - loc 677 - When it comes time to do the Full Color Work, the schedule must go and the creator must be free to create his masterpiece without regards to the clock.

 - loc 678 - A strict schedule is unnecessary and a detriment when performing Full Color Work. When doing work on a Full Color project, the only item on the to-do list is "do the work.” Sleep schedules must go, eating schedule must go and gym schedules must go. Full Color Work not only comes first, it comes only.

 - loc 703 - When you’re in the B&W world a strict schedule is not only appropriate, it is necessary. Work must be accomplished and to accomplish work you must have a plan and a schedule. B&W work must be scheduled according to the sun. You must rise as the sun rises and fall as the sun falls;

 - loc 727 - Quality sleep has to do with one thing and one thing only. To get quality sleep you have to get adequate oxygen while you are sleeping.

 - loc 727 - Quality sleep has to do with one thing and one thing only. To get quality sleep you have to get adequate oxygen while you are sleeping. Oxygen is the secret to sleeping less and achieving more.

 - loc 731 - You sleep on your side because sleeping on your back can cause the tongue and other muscles in the mouth to retreat into your throat, restricting your airway and keeping vital oxygen from you.

 - loc 733 - You sleep specifically on your left side because the human has two lungs; left lung and right lung. The left lung has two air pockets but the right lung has three air pockets. You sleep on your left side in an effort to get and keep as much oxygen you can. You do not want to cover your right lung with your bodyweight as it has more opportunity to retain oxygen.

 - loc 736 - Relaxation is for people who aren't headed anywhere. Instead of relaxing, you need only to become and remain calm.

 - loc 746 - The time between 10am-12pm are the two best hours in the entire day for creativity, productivity and enthusiasm. It is essential that you work undistracted during those two hours on your biggest and most important project.

 - loc 765 - As the sun starts to go down, so does our energy. This is the best time to take a break and do whatever you like. Humans will naturally have a 2nd wind around early evening time and that is when more work can be accomplished

 - loc 790 - The old world ronin were slaves without masters. A slave without a master is a curse, it is not a blessing. When you do not have a master - which is another word for mission - you are lost and aimless; like a ghost. Everybody needs missions and everybody needs masters, even masters.

 - loc 801 - We have been given new life by the gods of the internet, previously unavailable to all in history before us.  Respect the Gift of the Gods. The gods of the internet are the strongest of all gods. All NWR must never incur their wrath by taking them for granted.

 - loc 818 - The ronin must develop and become all 3 Bs: Body - Brain - Brand. The warrior-poet-businessman is the tri-angled foundation of the ronin artist entrepreneur

 - loc 824 - The Brand is God. The brand comes before all. The new allegiance of the Ronin becomes the brand. Every decision must be made with these thoughts: is this good for the brand or bad for the brand?   The ronin become both slave and master to the brand.

 - loc 837 - The ronin artist must be patient for one year before he tries to sell information. The ronin artist must be an expert in an area of knowledge to begin an information business.

 - loc 856 - The power of hearing the truth is magnetic. It draws people in or it repels people. Everybody in show business knows you want to be loved or hated, never in the middle.

 - loc 871 - No one cares about free art. The only art that has meaning is the art that people pay for. No one respects what comes easy and free.

 - loc 882 - It is not a matter of being better than the competition. The best do not see competition; instead, it is a matter of obsessive compulsion.

 - loc 899 - We all need obsessions and when we don’t have full color work to obsess on we obsess over trivialities like movies, news media, gossip etc.

 - loc 902 - We all have obsessions and the choice is to pick between the two: obsession that moves us forward or obsession that keeps us still.

 - loc 917 - Hard times are not hard: you "get through" the hard times by not allowing yourself to think of them as hard times. Can’t afford peanut butter? That’s not a financial disaster, it’s an adventure. The day I couldn’t buy peanut butter was one of the happiest days of my life,

 - loc 1001 - If you demand it and if you command it, Destiny will do anything for you. Destiny will steal, kill, lie and die for you. The only thing you have to do is look Destiny right into her eyes and say “I own you” and make sure you mean it.  With a little smile, a slight blush and a lot of eagerness, Destiny will say right back… yes, master!

 - loc 1034 - Don’t you know what Mike Tyson said? He said everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth. A business plan is highly essential in the world of paper-pushers, in the jungle it’s used as toilet paper. It is not something you need in reality because business plans are useless in reality. What you need to succeed is strategy.

 - loc 1049 - When visualizing the future, don’t think about the little steps along the way. Think about where you want to get to; how to get there is unimportant as long as you get there.

 - loc 1092 - The first sentence is the 2nd most important. The first paragraph is the 3rd most important. The beginning is often used to get filler text out of the way, which is a big mistake Always go big in the beginning.

 - loc 1170 - You've got to have a good little soldier at home. Having anyone else at home is a mistake. She's your little go‑getter. You need something, she goes and gets it. You need something done, she does it. But that's all behind the scenes. In public you're just normal people. Friendly everyday Joe and Jane. Behind the scenes you and your good little soldier plot and plan.

 - loc 1192 - Mary Kay: we must learn to eliminate resistance and be like water. Her management style is completely opposite to the management style presented in NWR and that is precisely why it must be studied.

 - loc 1192 - Mary Kay: we must learn to eliminate resistance and be like water. Her management style is completely opposite to the management style presented in NWR and that is precisely why it must be studied. Her management style was to praise her soldiers to success.

 - loc 1198 - Mary Kay exemplifies greatness and will be remembered through the ages. Her job was not to sell make-up; that was her black and white work. Her full color masterpiece was in giving her soldiers a reason to wake up in the morning, put their skirts on and go to work with purpose, spirit and a fiery attitude. “God did not have time to make a nobody, just a somebody. You are a somebody!” -Mary Kay Ash Mary Kay Ash gave sunshine to her soldiers and that is what makes a great human with a good heart.

 - loc 1271 - Get inspired, get fired up, do the work. Repeat.  Full Circle Wanderlust.

 - loc 1296 - We do not wait for energy, we make energy.

 - loc 1311 - The NWR must understand how difficult it can be to gain momentum and how easy it is to lose momentum. You must always keep that momentum going.

 - loc 1341 - Embrace the fact that satisfaction is a myth,

 - loc 1357 - Back-Up Plans are Plans to Fail. You have to be a little crazy to play the game with no net, but you also have to be a little crazy to be a tidal wave instead of a tear-drop.

 - loc 1362 - Kill your back-up plan, put her down like a mangy dog, put all of your energy into the game and become the character you were born to be, the true you. The former slave turned master. When you truly give in to the way of moving forward you cannot fail, it is impossible.

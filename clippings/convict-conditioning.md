 - loc 916 - A couple of fast sets every few workouts will be good for athleticism and variety. But despite this fact, the majority of your pushups should be done relatively slowly; for a count of two seconds down to the bottom position, a one second pause, and two seconds back up to the top position before immediately descending again.

 - loc 1719 - Before the Middle Ages when oxen were scarce during furrowing season, the farmer would handle the plough—controlling it with his strong upper body and arms—while his wife literally pulled it through the soil, using her strong legs and butt.

 - loc 2837 - Bridging—even just once per week—prevents all these problems. It realigns the vertebrae into the correct position, and strengthens the deep muscles of the back responsible for proper posture. Even the bones become stronger over time, with the practice of the bridge. The discs in your back are made of cartilage, and like all cartilage, they have very little blood flow. Instead, they receive their nutrition from liquid in the joints, called synovial fluid. Because it’s not associated with the circulation, fresh fluid can only reach the joints when those joints move around. Bridging removes waste and sends plenty of nutritious fluid to the discs, healing them, preventing degeneration and ensuring maximal health. Strong spinal muscles can reduce the likelihood of slipped discs, and even help fix the condition.

 - loc 3712 - Warming up not only reduces the risk of injury, it also prepares the nervous system for action, sends fresh, shock-absorbing synovial fluid around the joints, and focuses the mind for the harder work to come.

 - loc 3719 - The most efficient way to warm up is with two to four progressively harder higher rep sets of the movement you are going to be performing for your work sets.

 - loc 3755 - if you build a head of steam by moving forwards more slowly, you’ll actually reach your goals much faster than if you proceeded with haste. This sounds like a paradox, but it’s true. The old-timers of the iron game understood this principle only too well. They used to talk in terms of “milking” a program, and “putting strength in the bank.” One of the old sayings wise weightlifting coaches used force down the throats of eager young trainees was the phrase; the heavy weight isn’t going anywhere.

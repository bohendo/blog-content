#  What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars
## by Brendan Moynihan

 - loc 48 - If you have never picked up a violin, your chances of playing successful solo violin in front of the New York Philharmonic are zero. It is just that trading has this quirk that allows some people to be successful temporarily without true skill or an edge—and that fools people into mistaking luck for skill.

 - loc 82 - I use Jim Paul’s story as a parable to point out the three biggest mistakes that investors and traders make every day in the markets. These have not changed and never will.

 - loc 102 - Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain lucky. They think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees success.

 - loc 109 - Warren Buffettt, the richest man in America, is quoted on the cover of Forbes’s 1993 edition of the “400 Richest People in America”: “I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and I’m a better businessman because I’m an investor.” If the elements of success can be transferred between the markets and business, the elements of failure can too.

 - loc 152 - there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in the markets, but there are relatively few ways to lose money in the markets. People lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological factors that prevent the application of the analysis. Most of the losses are due to the latter.

 - loc 196 - Drucker has also said, “Success always obsoletes the behavior that achieved it.”

 - loc 199 - Personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure. They begin to treat the success as a personal reflection rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity, being at the right place at the right time, or even being just plain lucky.

 - loc 333 - “My buddy Jim Hersha and I are going through rush and, frankly, we’re a little tired of going to all these parties—the Delts, the Sigma Nus, the Sig Eps, the SAEs. We’ve kind of had it. We’d like to come over to the house and pick up our pledge pins.” We went over to the house and, unbelievably, they gave us pledge pins. Now that I know how it is supposed to work, I can’t believe we got away with that. We had the chutzpah to invite ourselves to be Kappa Sigs instead of their inviting us. We simply didn’t know any better. We were breaking the rules and didn’t even know it.

 - loc 437 - I introduced myself to the owner, which was kind of audacious for a former bus boy. But, once again, I didn’t know any better.

 - loc 437 - I introduced myself to the owner, which was kind of audacious for a former bus boy. But, once again, I didn’t know any better. I said to the owner, “Okay, here’s my problem. I’m going to go into the military sooner or later, but in the meantime I’d like a job. I don’t want to be a bus boy. I’m twenty-two years old and a college graduate, so I don’t want to be a bus boy. I really don’t want to be a waiter either. I think I’d like to be a bartender.” To my surprise he said, “Okay.”

 - loc 462 - Basic training and OCS are a lot like the pledge games in the fraternity. They test you by giving you things to do in impossibly short time frames. They do it to see what happens to you when you get stressed out. That’s the game: “Let’s give this guy an impossible situation and see what happens.”

 - loc 701 - was head and shoulders above everybody. Just like at the country club when I wanted to ingratiate myself with the movers and shakers, I wanted to get to know Gimble.

 - loc 701 - He was head and shoulders above everybody. Just like at the country club when I wanted to ingratiate myself with the movers and shakers, I wanted to get to know Gimble. So, not knowing any better (just like when I got my pledge pin), I walked up to him one day and said, “Stu, can I take you to lunch?” “I don’t go to lunch.” “Can I take you to dinner? Can I take you for a drink? Look, you can call it anything you want, I just want to go out and talk with you. You’re the best trader in the pit so you’re the man I gotta talk to.” “Okay, we’ll go to lunch.”

 - loc 722 - I did everything I could to get elected. I sent platform letters. I had Jack Salmon send letters. Then I sent hand-written letters asking for votes. Well, nobody else was really running. They were all doing the “I don’t want to run because I don’t want to lose” routine. If you run aggressively in that situation, you win by a landslide. I won 121 votes out of 150

 - loc 722 - I did everything I could to get elected. I sent platform letters. I had Jack Salmon send letters. Then I sent hand-written letters asking for votes. Well, nobody else was really running. They were all doing the “I don’t want to run because I don’t want to lose” routine. If you run aggressively in that situation, you win by a landslide. I won 121 votes out of 150 votes.

 - loc 728 - Anytime you see a committee of more than ten, it isn’t the real committee. There’s a subcommittee somewhere making the decisions.

 - loc 886 - One of the oldest rules of trading is: If a market is hit with very bullish news and instead of going up, the market goes down, get out if you’re long. An unexpected and opposite reaction means there is something seriously wrong with the position.

 - loc 910 - The high from “being right” the market and making all that money is unbelievable. It cannot be duplicated with drugs. You are totally invincible.

 - loc 910 - The high from “being right” the market and making all that money is unbelievable. It cannot be duplicated with drugs. You are totally invincible. You are impervious to all pain. There’s nothing bad in the world. It’s literally like you expect God to call any minute and ask, “Is it okay if I let the sun come up tomorrow morning?” And after thinking about it for a minute you’ll probably say, “Yeah, go ahead.”

 - loc 925 - I literally assumed I was going to make more money. The question was not whether I was going to make money. The question was how much money was I going to make.

 - loc 928 - (Here’s another sign of having lost control. Here’s someone who has lost $30,000 and is saying, “Hmmm. That’s not so bad.” That’s a little nuts. Right? I’d just lost $30,000 in the first five minutes of Friday and I was feeling fine. “No problem. Too bad we can’t buy more of these.”)

 - loc 933 - We actually had the chutzpah to think it was “good news” that wonder-trader Richard Dennis was on the other side of our position.

 - loc 977 - The clients I advised were sophisticated and experienced traders in their own right, and they had been bailing out of the market since early September. As far as I was concerned, this demonstrated their lack of courage to buy with pride and hold with conviction.

 - loc 1001 - We were holding each other’s hands, and every day we went through this little drill of losing an average of $20,000 to $25,000 but telling ourselves that it was going to be all right. Naturally, it never was.

 - loc 1001 - We were holding each other’s hands, and every day we went through this little drill of losing an average of $20,000 to $25,000 but telling ourselves that it was going to be all right. Naturally, it never was. It got to be excruciatingly painful. But I couldn’t get out of the market because as long as I had the position on, there was always the belief, the chance, the hope, that I could make back the money. If I got out of the market there wouldn’t be any chance anymore.

 - loc 1063 - The money I’d made over the years “trading” wasn’t because I was a good trader. I’d made money because of being a good sales man, being at the right place at the right time, and knowing the right people, rather than because of some innate trading ability.

 - loc 1155 - Obviously, there is no secret way to make money because the pros have done it using very different and often contradictory approaches. Learning how not to lose money is more important than learning how to make money.

 - loc 1184 - pearls of trading wisdom are more easily repeated than implemented.

 - loc 1189 - Memorizing and repeating clichés is easy; grasping their underlying principles is more difficult.

 - loc 1217 - Most people equate loss with being wrong and, therefore, internalize what should be an external loss.

 - loc 1217 - Most people equate loss with being wrong and, therefore, internalize what should be an external loss. Then they start to experience the Five Stages of Internal Loss, and the loss gets larger as they progress through the stages.

 - loc 1279 - An objective loss is impervious to how you feel about it or react to it. It’s not subject to anyone’s appraisal; it must be accepted without evaluation.

 - loc 1281 - Because people tend to regard loss, wrong, bad, and failure as the same thing, it is little wonder that loss is a dirty word in our vocabulary. However, in the markets losses should be viewed like the light bulbs or rotten fruit mentioned earlier: part of the business and taken with equanimity. Loss is not the same as wrong, and loss is not necessarily bad. For example, consider exiting a losing position with a small loss but before the loss got bigger. That was a loss, but it was a good decision.

 - loc 1293 - Facts are neither right nor wrong; they simply are. Opinions are personal assessments and are right or wrong depending on whether they actually correspond with the facts. Therefore, only opinions can be right or wrong; facts cannot.

 - loc 1299 - In 20/20 hindsight, decisions might be good or bad but not right or wrong. With regard to the markets, only expressed opinions can be right or wrong. Market positions are either profitable or unprofitable, period.

 - loc 1314 - the stages people go through when experiencing a loss in the market are strikingly similar to the stages people go through when facing death.

 - loc 1326 - If you can’t even, or don’t dare, sit down and calculate how much you’re losing in a position, but you know to the exact penny how much you’re making on your profitable positions, then you’re denying the loss.

 - loc 1335 - In September 1983 I made a pact with myself that if the market rallied back to where it had been in late August I’d get out of the position. By November I was begging the market just to get my position back to breakeven.

 - loc 1341 - I was so consumed with the bean-oil position that I couldn’t sleep through the night, skipped meals, lost fifteen pounds in four weeks, and lost interest in all the things that I once had found enjoyable.

 - loc 1351 - For terminally ill patients, the one thing that usually persists through all these stages is hope. Even the most accepting patients left open the possibility for some cure, the discovery of a new drug or last-minute success in a research project. They showed the greatest confidence in the doctors who allowed for such hope and appreciated it when hope was offered in spite of bad news. This is the same hope I was relying on when the bean-oil position was deteriorating.

 - loc 1362 - The market participant doesn’t have to move directly to the acceptance stage. He can loop back to denial after each and every temporary reprieve the market gives him. If the market rallies some, he thinks the market has finally turned. But when the market starts back down again, he slips back into denial, then anger, and so on.

 - loc 1365 - Even if the position is a net profit, the trader or investor can go through the Five Stages. Consider when a market position is profitable but not as profitable as it once was. When that happens, he becomes married to the price at which it was the most profitable. He denies that the move is over, gets angry when the market starts to sell off, makes a bargain that he’ll get out if the market moves back to that arbitrary point, gets depressed that he didn’t get out, and maybe even lets the profit turn into a loss, thus slipping again into denial, then anger, etc.

 - loc 1377 - Losses from continuous processes are much more prone to become internalized because, like all internal losses, there is no predetermined ending point.

 - loc 1424 - Most people who think they are investing are speculating. And most people who think they are speculating are gambling.

 - loc 1478 - The big difference is: gambling creates risk while investing/speculating assumes and manages risk that already exists.

 - loc 1491 - Investing is parting with capital in the expectation of safety of principal and an adequate return on the capital in the form of dividends, interest, or rent.

 - loc 1499 - In its most basic definition, trading is market making. The trader essentially tries to stay net flat (neither long nor short) and makes money by extracting the bid-ask spread.

 - loc 1502 - Speculating is parting with capital in the expectation of capital appreciation. This capital appreciation is the sole extent of “return” for the speculator.

 - loc 1506 - Betting is an agreement between two parties where the party proved wrong about the outcome of an uncertain event will forfeit a stipulated thing or sum to the other party.

 - loc 1511 - Gambling is a derivative of betting. To gamble is to wager money on the outcome of a game, contest, or event or to play a game of chance for money or other stakes. Gambling usually involves a game or event of chance; sometimes it involves games of both skill and chance.

 - loc 1520 - Gambling, investing, and trading are not defined by any particular activity itself (i.e., playing cards, buying stocks, or trading futures) but by how the person approaches the activity.

 - loc 1524 - the distinguishing characteristic of a bettor or a gambler is whether he wants the satisfaction of being right in his prediction or the entertainment of participating, respectively

 - loc 1540 - It is important to understand that not all participants in gambling games are gamblers. The aim of the “professional gambler,” as he is called, is to make money.

 - loc 1544 - The professional gambler is similar to the stock arbitrageur in that they both take calculated risks. They are dealing with an uncertain outcome and seek to profit from their ability to anticipate the future or to see the future—in other words, to speculate. Professional gamblers are actually speculators because of the characteristics they exhibit when risking money. They are not seeking entertainment at the tables like gamblers do, and they are not trying to be right. They are trying to make money.

 - loc 1546 - Professional gamblers are actually speculators because of the characteristics they exhibit when risking money. They are not seeking entertainment at the tables like gamblers do, and they are not trying to be right. They are trying to make money.

 - loc 1555 - If a person approaches a business risk or a risk in the financial markets for excitement, then he is gambling—regardless of how much control he supposedly has over the outcome

 - loc 1569 - Betting and gambling are suitable for discrete events but not for continuous processes. If you introduce the behavioral characteristics of betting or gambling into a continuous process, you are leaving yourself open to enormous losses.

 - loc 1583 - The first psychological fallacy is the tendency to overvalue wagers involving a low probability of a high gain and to undervalue wagers involving a relatively high probability of low gain.

 - loc 1585 - The second is a tendency to interpret the probability of successive independent events as additive rather than multiplicative. In other words, people view the chance of throwing a given number on a die to be twice as large with two throws as it is with a single throw—

 - loc 1588 - The third is the belief that after a run of successes, a failure is mathematically inevitable, and vice versa.

 - loc 1590 - Fourth is the perception that the psychological probability of the occurrence of an event exceeds the mathematical probability if the event is favorable and vice versa.

 - loc 1590 - Fourth is the perception that the psychological probability of the occurrence of an event exceeds the mathematical probability if the event is favorable and vice versa. For example, the probability of success of drawing the winning ticket in the lottery and the probability of being killed by lightning may both be one in 10,000, yet from a personal viewpoint, buying the winning lottery ticket is considered much more probable than getting hit by lightning.

 - loc 1594 - Fifth is people’s tendency to overestimate the frequency of the occurrence of infrequent events and to underestimate that of comparatively frequent ones after observing a series of randomly generated events of different kinds with an interest in the frequency with which each kind of event occurs. Thus, they remember the “streaks” in a long series of wins and losses and tend to minimize the number of short-term runs.

 - loc 1597 - Sixth is people’s tendency to confuse the occurrence of “unusual” events with the occurrence of low-probability events.

 - loc 1606 - The definition of risk is to expose to the chance or possibility of loss. Most people erroneously try to assign a numerical value to that chance, which simply confuses risk with probability. In the markets we are talking about unique, nonrepeatable events, so we can’t assign a frequency probability to their occurrence.

 - loc 1612 - Perhaps the most common fallacy to which market participants are susceptible is money odds vs. probability odds. Many market participants express the probability of success in terms of a risk-reward ratio. For example, if I bought my famous takeover stock (which you will hear about in the next chapter) at twenty-six dollars and placed a sell stop below the market at twenty-three dollars with an upside objective of thirty-six dollars, my risk-reward ratio would be three to ten. Risk three dollars to make ten dollars. It is clear that I don’t understand probability. Couching my rationalizations in arithmetic terms does not automatically lend credibility to my position. The three-to-ten ratio has nothing to do with the probability that the stock can or will get to thirty-six dollars. All the ratio does is compare the dollar amount of what I think I might lose to the dollar amount of what I think I might make. But it doesn’t say anything about the probability of either event occurring

 - loc 1695 - Emotions are neither good nor bad; they simply are. They cannot be avoided. But emotionalism (i.e., decision making based on emotions) is bad, can be controlled, and should be avoided.

 - loc 1698 - the fundamental characteristic of a crowd is that it is exclusively guided by unconscious motives. In other words, it is guided by emotions.

 - loc 1742 - The basic distinction between the individual and the crowd is that the individual acts after reasoning, deliberation, and analysis; a crowd acts on feeling, emotion, and impulses.

 - loc 1772 - A person in a crowd also allows himself to be induced to commit acts contrary to his most obvious interests. One of the most incomprehensible features of a crowd is the tenacity with which the members adhere to erroneous assumptions despite mounting evidence to challenge them.

 - loc 1783 - The similarities between a psychological crowd and a losing market participant are striking. Remember, it is not a function of a quantity of individuals that determines if a psychological crowd has formed. Rather, it is a function of the characteristics displayed. If a person is exhibiting these characteristics, then he is part of a psychological crowd and is making crowd trades.

 - loc 1797 - He is ready! Because he is so anxious to make money, he is in a state of expectant attention. He hears a tip or a casual comment about the market; enthusiasm is contagious and he goes into a hypnotic-like trance, takes the tip as gospel, and acts on it.

 - loc 1809 - Prestige is a sort of domination exercised over us by an individual, a work, an idea, or a wish. It entirely paralyzes our critical faculty and fills us with wonderment. The market is going your way; you look like a hero; you’re so smart (prestige); you have the adulation of your peers. Emotionalism overwhelms you (contagion). You’re hypnotized.

 - loc 1809 - Prestige is a sort of domination exercised over us by an individual, a work, an idea, or a wish. It entirely paralyzes our critical faculty and fills us with wonderment. The market is going your way; you look like a hero; you’re so smart (prestige); you have the adulation of your peers. Emotionalism overwhelms you (contagion). You’re hypnotized. The illusion model can also be applied to losing trades if the prestige involved comes from your daring actions and being able to take the punishment of a losing position. Sure, the market is against you, but you’re courageous and you can take it.

 - loc 1918 - When dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have three choices: engineering, gambling, or speculating.

 - loc 1958 - Broadly speaking, the decision-making process is as follows: (1) Decide what type of participant you’re going to be, (2) select a method of analysis, (3) develop rules, (4) establish controls, and (5) formulate a plan.

 - loc 1964 - The first thing you decide is what type of participant you are going to be (investor or speculator). Then you select what market you are going to participate in (stocks, bonds, currencies, futures). The plan you develop must be consistent with the characteristics and time horizon of the type of participant you choose to be. Why? Changing your initial time horizon in the middle of a trade changes the type of participant you are and is almost as dangerous as betting or gambling in the market.

 - loc 1970 - “I really think you ought to buy XYZ here, Jim. It’s trading at $20, and it’s going to $30.” We buy and it goes down to $15. “It’s really a good deal here at $15. It’s gonna be fine.” So we buy more. Then it goes to $10. “Okay, we’re taking the long term view. That’s an investment.”

 - loc 2007 - In order to translate your analysis into something more than mere commentary, you need to define what constitutes an opportunity for you. That’s what rules do; they implement your analysis. Rules are hard-and-fast. Tools (i.e., methods of analysis) have some flexibility in how they are used. Fools have neither rules nor tools.

 - loc 2015 - Drucker reminds us, “There is no perfect decision. One always has to pay a price which might mean passing up an opportunity.”6 You have to accept the fact that profitable situations will occur that you won’t participate in. Don’t worry about the ones you miss; they were someone else’s. Your rules will only enable you to participate in some of the millions of possible opportunities, not all of them.

 - loc 2037 - Besides, since there are so many different plans one can follow and be successful, it matters less what the plan is than it does that there is a plan.

 - loc 2040 - before you decide to get into the market you have to decide where (price) or when (time) or why (new information) you will no longer want the position.

 - loc 2042 - Almost all commentary on the development of a plan will list the ingredients as entry, stop-loss, and price objective. However, to be effective as a loss-control tool, the plan must be derived by deciding STOP, ENTRY, then PRICE OBJECTIVE. Failure to choose a price objective could cost the trader some potential profits. A poor entry price could increase losses or reduce profits. But not having a predetermined stop-loss can, and ultimately will, cost you a lot of money.

 - loc 2050 - “The first step in planning is to ask of any activity, any product, any process or market, ‘If we were not committed to it today, would we go into it?’ If the answer is no, one says, ‘How can we get out—fast?’”

 - loc 2066 - Your plan is a script of what you expect to happen based on your particular method of analysis and provides a clear course of action if it doesn’t happen; you have prepared for different scenarios and know how you will react to each of them. This doesn’t mean you’re predicting the future. It means you know ahead of time what alternative courses of action you will take if event A, B, or C happens.

 - loc 2066 - Your plan is a script of what you expect to happen based on your particular method of analysis and provides a clear course of action if it doesn’t happen; you have prepared for different scenarios and know how you will react to each of them. This doesn’t mean you’re predicting the future. It means you know ahead of time what alternative courses of action you will take if event A, B, or C happens. The soundness of this approach for both markets and business is evidenced by something called scenario planning: “a structured, disciplined method for thinking about the future and a technique for anticipating developments in fluid political and economic situations.”

 - loc 2095 - Let me tell you some good news and some bad news about “why” and the markets. The good news is, if you’re long and the market is going up and you don’t have a clue as to why, you get to keep all the money. Every cent. They don’t charge you a single penny if you were “only lucky.” The bad news is, if the market is going up and you’re short and you know exactly why it’s up, you don’t get any money back. Now how important is it to know why?

 - loc 2149 - I have learned that the more the markets are treated as a game, the less likely you are to have losses due to psychological factors. Why? Games have rules and defined ending points. Their participants have a game plan.

 - loc 2163 - “Weak is he who allows his actions to be controlled by his emotions, and strong is he who forces his actions to control his emotions.” If you’re not consciously doing the latter, then you’re unconsciously doing the former,

 - loc 2234 - Participating in the markets is about making money; it’s about decision making implemented by a plan. And if implemented properly, it’s actually quite boring waiting for your buy/sell criteria to materialize. The minute it starts getting exciting, you are gambling.

 - loc 2267 - judge yourself by the degree to which you objectively defined the parameters/conditions that would constitute an opportunity and how well you adhered to them. In other words, pat yourself on the back or kick yourself in the backside depending on whether you develop a plan from a method of analysis, implement the plan via rules, and then follow the rules.

 - loc 2334 - And the firm carries out that planning by having staffers write detailed reports about all the consequences for the firm if certain hypothetical events came to pass. The worst-case scenarios are compiled in what the firm calls blue books. “‘We’re constantly writing these stupid blue books,’ grumbles one Morgan Stanley principal. ‘It definitely slows us down.’ On the other hand, he concedes with a shrug, ‘We don’t make any mistakes.’”

 - loc 2334 - And the firm carries out that planning by having staffers write detailed reports about all the consequences for the firm if certain hypothetical events came to pass. The worst-case scenarios are compiled in what the firm calls blue books. “‘We’re constantly writing these stupid blue books,’ grumbles one Morgan Stanley principal. ‘It definitely slows us down.’ On the other hand, he concedes with a shrug, ‘We don’t make any mistakes.’”29 Whether Morgan Stanley makes mistakes is open to debate, but its mistakes are contained.

 - loc 2335 - The worst-case scenarios are compiled in what the firm calls blue books. “‘We’re constantly writing these stupid blue books,’ grumbles one Morgan Stanley principal. ‘It definitely slows us down.’ On the other hand, he concedes with a shrug, ‘We don’t make any mistakes.’”

 - loc 2389 - You can be rewarded for doing the “wrong thing,” and you can be rewarded for doing the “right thing” for the wrong reason. I did that a lot during the early part of my life. However, if you continue to do the wrong thing in the market and get rewarded, your profits won’t be linked to any particular recurring set of circumstances or rule following on your part. This will result in what psychologists call a random reward schedule, the strongest form of reinforcement for getting a person to repeat a behavior.

 - loc 2422 - The market is no place for “making the wrong move at the right time.” Any deviation from your plan triggers the potential for losses due to psychological factors

 - loc 2437 - There is an inverse relationship between your threshold of pain and success in the markets, so as soon as you feel the pain: get out. What if you have on a long position and prices are going up, does that feel good? Do you know what you’re supposed to do? Keep feeling good; leave it alone. It’s working fine. Stay with positions that make you feel good; get out of positions that make you feel bad.

 - loc 2486 - Goizueta had every reason for self-congratulation. Yet in 1983 he said, “There is a danger when a company is doing as well as we are. And that is, to think that we can do no wrong: we can do wrong and we can do wrong big.”

 - loc 2518 - “An essential quality needed by a good salesman is a particular kind of ego drive which makes him want to make the sale in a personal or ego way, not merely for the money to be gained. His self-picture improves dramatically by virtue of making the sale and diminishes with failure.”12 It is precisely this quality which is so detrimental to a Speculator and any other type of decision maker. Realizing this helped me understand why I was able to make so much money as a salesman yet couldn’t make a dime as a trader.

 - loc 182 - only a disciple because your eyes are closed.The day you open them you will see there is nothing youcan learn from me or anyone. What then is a Master for?To make you see the uselessness of having one. Anthony de Mello

 - loc 298 - Beyond I Am, it's all belief. There is nothing to know because there is only consciousness, and that thou art. Ignorance is not a matter of what we don't know, but what we do know that's not true. In the dreamstate, false knowledge is everything and true knowledge is Sentio, ergo sum. I am aware, therefore I am. I-Am/Consciousness.

 - loc 388 - Brahman is consciousnesses; the impersonal, featureless infinite. Maya is the creator of the dreamstate, and Atman is the aspect of Brahman that beholds Maya's creation. They are not entities, they are tools for understanding. On the truth side of the hard wall is Brahman. Maya and Atman are on the belief side.

 - loc 394 - because the Mayan aspect of Brahman can create illusion doesn't mean that the Atmanic aspect of Brahman can be deceived by it, and without that, there is no solution to the problem of Brahmanic boredom.

 - loc 394 - Just because the Mayan aspect of Brahman can create illusion doesn't mean that the Atmanic aspect of Brahman can be deceived by it, and without that, there is no solution to the problem of Brahmanic boredom.

 - loc 415 - Because we can't know that we think, Descartes should have said sentio, ergo sum; I am aware, therefore I am. Cogito is just another appearance about which I can be deceived, Sentio is not.

 - loc 415 - Because we can't know that we think, Descartes should have said sentio, ergo sum; I am aware, therefore I am. Cogito is just another appearance about which I can be deceived, Sentio is not. The distinction between "I think" and "I am aware" is right where we're stuck at the moment. I know I'm aware, but I only believe that I think.

 - loc 431 - Some things may be true within the context of a story, but the story itself is a false context. This applies to the story we call reality; there are no facts to work with, it's all just imagination, including the appearance of coherence; intelligence. We can't hold the dreamstate to account, and we can't summon the author and demand a straight answer because the author is just another character in the story.

 - loc 560 - The most important thing to know about the event horizon is that you never know where it is until you cross it, and then it's too late.

 - loc 665 - The shortcoming of perfection is that it's perfect, and for this reason, the universe can't be exciting or surprising. It cannot amuse. It can only sit there, ticking along like a Swiss watch; always perfect, no surprises.

 - loc 684 - So that's what we have; awareness and appearance. There is no other element, and even appearance doesn't really exist, so for any question starting in why—Why is the sky blue? Why is there evil? Why doesn't mommy love me? Why am I strangling this parakeet?—the answer must be, for the amusement of Brahman.

 - loc 709 - My reason for thinking the moon missions were faked is that the chances of success would have been unacceptably low and the price of failure outrageously high. That's it.

 - loc 730 - When you weigh the likelihood of a hoax against the claim of six successful landings and one spectacularly successful failure, the conclusion you arrive at really depends on you. You might waver back and forth several times a day, or you might lock onto one side or the other and stay there. Reason plays a distant second to emotion in this, as in everything.

 - loc 987 - He probably experienced a violent awakening before setting pen to paper. The writing was his attempt to make sense of the process as it unfolded." "You make it sound like he was a victim of it." "That's always how it is."

 - loc 987 - "Yes, your grandfather's experience was greatly intensified by circumstances. He probably experienced a violent awakening before setting pen to paper. The writing was his attempt to make sense of the process as it unfolded." "You make it sound like he was a victim of it." "That's always how it is."

 - loc 1074 - Your old life didn't make much sense, but as long as you didn't know that, it didn't matter. But now you know, so now it does.

 - loc 1155 - The big bang and Genesis and other creation myths provide false answers, but when we're really done with the question we won't have answered it, we'll have destroyed it."

 - loc 1166 - creation myth doesn't really have to make sense, it just has to be good enough. The reason you don't see angry mobs outside churches and universities demanding less ridiculous stories is because we're all in the same boat. We all have the same black hole inside and we're all existentially motivated to go along with the cover-up. That's what these myths do; they help us comfortably ignore these big flashing signs that tell us our stories don't make sense."

 - loc 1172 - Eden is the inner black hole from which we emerge and to which we return, but the whole dramatic element of the dreamstate depends on us not being aware of it. If Ken and Barbie awaken to the fact that they're just hollow plastic dolls, they'll stop performing and the whole thing is over, so that flashing sword is warning them away from truth, away from the realization of meaninglessness, keeping them safely confined within the dramatic production they exist to serve."

 - loc 1179 - "Eden is awareness of the abyss. To see it is to enter it, no difference, so it's not that we can't go there, it's that we're protected from thinking it's there. It has to be gated and guarded against our powers of reason. That's the emotional hobbling we mentioned, it keeps us in character. Yeah, that's better."

 - loc 1249 - I can't confirm the content of appearance, but I can confirm the appearance itself. Not what I dream of, but that I dream. Descartes' Evil Demon can deceive me about everything except the fact that I exist, of which I am certain because I am aware. That's the difference between everything I believe and the one thing I know, but if the appearances which provide the basis of my self-awareness are illusory, can I still claim them as proof of my existence? Yes. Regardless of what I am aware of, I am aware, and as Descartes rightly stated, the Demon can't deceive me about that.

 - loc 1249 - I can't confirm the content of appearance, but I can confirm the appearance itself. Not what I dream of, but that I dream. Descartes' Evil Demon can deceive me about everything except the fact that I exist, of which I am certain because I am aware.

 - loc 1253 - Brahman is perceiver, Atman is the process of perception, and Maya is the perceived. Perceiver, perception and perceived are not three but one; consciousness. Consciousness, being one without other, can only be conscious of itself, like a mirror reflecting itself in a void, creating from nothing the appearance of everything; creatio ex nihilo. So, based on the certain fact that there is only consciousness, we can conclude that the dreamstate universe is, essentially, an infinity mirror.

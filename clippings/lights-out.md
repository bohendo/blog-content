 - loc 223 - Increased intake of carbohydrates (sugar) is always dumped into increased cholesterol production, too, because the carbs lower the freezing temperature of the cell membrane. In the real world, you’d never have access to that much sugar unless it was summer before winter.

 - loc 252 - Chronic high cortisol also skews your time perception, making you feel continually rushed. It’s the altered time perception that fosters much of the late-night stalling before bed, while you stay up under the impression that there must be more to do or that you haven’t finished your work.

 - loc 340 - Your subconscious has, over the course of evolution, been conditioned and fine-tuned to believe and act on the following when the lights stay on too long: “Eat carbohydrates now or die later.”

 - loc 346 - Your body translates long hours of artificial light into summertime. Because it instinctively knows that summer comes before winter, and that winter means no available food, you begin to crave carbohydrates so you can store fat for a time when food is scarce and you should be hibernating.

 - loc 639 - Understanding human physiological dysfunction is akin to repairing a broken vase. You start with the big pieces and, finally, all that’s left is the impact point. Those tiny shards will go together in the end, but you never could have started there.

 - loc 690 - There is an enormous difference between knowledge, information, and understanding. In our time, we’ve gained enormous understanding of the natural world through a wealth of information, but we’ve lost the knowledge of how we fit into that world.

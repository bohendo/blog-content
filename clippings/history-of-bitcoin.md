 - loc 292 - March 11, 2013 Bitcoin developers inadvertently release a version of the Bitcoin client that is incompatible with prior versions. This causes a fork in the blockchain, with miners and users who did not upgrade to the new version existing on a separate chain from those who upgraded.

 - loc 358 - December 18, 2013 BitcoinTalk user GameKyuubi makes a rambling drunken post entitled “I AM HODLING”, which shouts the virtues of holding BTC in the midst of the current sharp downtrend in price.

The Cypriot police issue an arrest warrant, and Brewster remains in hiding (presumably in the UK) until early 2016.

 - loc 406 - June 13, 2014 A single mining collective known as Ghash.io officially controls 51% of the Bitcoin network’s mining power. This is not a scam or a hack, but rather a natural consequence of Ghash.io’s popularity in the fast-growing Bitcoin mining ecosystem.

 - loc 419 - September 8, 2014 Payment processor Braintree, a subsidiary of Paypal, begins accepting bitcoin.

 - loc 459 - August 15, 2015 Bitcoin Developers Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen release Bitcoin XT, a new version of the standard Bitcoin Core client that allows for larger block sizes that increase over time as needed.

 - loc 464 - Bitcoin XT fails to gain sufficient support, and the philosophical debate over scaling mechanisms continues. Members of the community and press half-jokingly refer to the contentious and often vitriolic debate over block size as the Bitcoin Civil War.

 - loc 469 - September 18, 2015 The US Commodities Future Trading Commission declares that bitcoin is a commodity, similar to any consumer good, and therefore under the purview of the Commodity Exchange Act. This move falls short of recognizing bitcoin as money and is considered a blatant step by the US government towards regulating it.

 - loc 472 - September 22, 2015 Bitcoin exchange Circle becomes the first company to receive a New York bitlicense,

 - loc 485 - December 1, 2015 The US Securities and Exchange Commission declares Bitcoin mining companies GAWMiners and ZenMiner to be Ponzi schemes.

Bugs plague Bitcoin Unlimited after release. In early 2017 only 11% of Bitcoin nodes run Bitcoin Unlimited.

 - loc 504 - February 10, 2016 Bitcoin Classic, a third fork of Bitcoin Core is released. Bitcoin Classic proposes a single increase to the block size from 1MB to 2MB followed by a democratic process to decide on future changes.

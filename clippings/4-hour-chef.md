 - loc 298 - The Art of Simple Food by Chez Panisse founder Alice Waters

 - loc 325 - I eventually learned to cook by focusing on two principles. Both of them apply to all learning and will be your constant companions throughout this book: failure points and the margin of safety.

 - loc 394 - In restaurants, the distinction between cook and chef is important: someone who can cook is a cook, whereas someone who can create a menu and run a kitchen is a chef. Calling yourself the latter when you’re the former, as many TV hosts do, is a no-no. In some circles, the cook is a technician, however good, and the chef is the conductor. The former is the bricklayer, the latter the architect of the cathedral.

 - loc 543 - The top 1% often succeed despite how they train, not because of it. Superior genetics, or a luxurious full-time schedule, make up for a lot.

 - loc 615 - I’d developed two simple lenses through which I viewed language-learning methods, and learning in general: Is the method effective? Have you narrowed down your material to the highest frequency? Is the method sustainable? Have you chosen a schedule and subject matter that you can stick with (or at least put up with) until reaching fluency? Will you actually swallow the pill you’ve prescribed yourself?

 - loc 658 - the 1980s cultural contribution to modern English: diss. Just remember diss with an extra s: DiSSS.

 - loc 1053 - Cinnamon and chile powder on vanilla ice cream. Olive oil on chocolate ice cream (bonus point: put an olive oil–fried sage leaf on top). Cinnamon on bacon. Almond butter on hamburger. Black pepper on watermelon. Mustard on black-eyed peas. Cinnamon on grilled pineapple (a favorite in churrascaria, grilled meat restaurants in Brazil).

 - loc 1157 - Braising Sautéing Grilling 1. Braising 2. Sautéing 3. Grilling These will be taught as universal principles that apply: Make one braise and you can make them all. Sauté one dish and you can sauté them all. Grill one fish and you can, to a degree (get it?), wing it and get it right.

 - loc 1360 - No matter how good a plan is, how thorough a book is, or how sincere our intentions, humans are horrible at self-discipline. No one is immune. The smartest, richest, and most dedicated people abandon commitments with disgusting regularity.

 - loc 1456 - I use two different types of one-pagers: The first is the Prescriptive One-Pager, which lists principles that help you generate real-world examples. In short: “Here are the rules.”30 The second is the Practice One-Pager, which lists real-world examples to practice that indirectly teach the principles.

 - loc 1892 - Some weirdos, like me, love the high-concentration, high-reward sprint. Others will find it masochistic, preferring a Zen-like tempo.

 - loc 2278 - I don’t want you to think of “cooking” as one activity. Think of it as “prep,” things that can be done hours/days in advance, and “pickup,” or what you do when you decide it’s time to eat. This will greatly reduce feeling rushed. So remember: it’s no longer cooking, it’s prep and pickup.

 - loc 2300 - Read each recipe from start to finish before buying ingredients or trying anything.

 - loc 2302 - When you make each dish, you have a choice: follow the longer directions step-by-step, or refer to the nutshell version at the

 - loc 2305 - Don’t worry about being exact unless I tell you to.

 - loc 2308 - How you make the recipe the first time is the “lesson”; how you make it after that is up to you.

 - loc 2344 - Take photographs of your meals and share them, whether through Facebook, Twitter, or e-mail. Tracking begets feedback, which begets more tracking. This virtuous cycle will dramatically accelerate your learning and results.

 - loc 3226 - To cover all four, the only ingredients you need are scallions, ginger, chile, lime, cilantro, and soy sauce or tamari. They can be applied to anything—chicken, beef, pork, and vegetables of all types—giving you dozens, if not hundreds, of dishes at your fingertips.

 - loc 3230 - Ethnic Cuisine, by Elisabeth Rozin, a brilliant book that never got the attention it deserved.

 - loc 3230 - The table "Flavor Combinations" below was inspired by Ethnic Cuisine, by Elisabeth Rozin, a brilliant book that never got the attention it deserved.

 - loc 3255 - Getting foods to room temperature is referred to as “tempering” and is critical to good cooking, especially when working with meats. As a general rule, never cook cold or cool food, as you’ll burn the outside and leave the inside undercooked.

 - loc 3265 - Cutting a slit instead of cutting it in half allows you to squeeze out only what you need, and store the lemon in the fridge without a bag.

 - loc 3274 - To avoid pushing shell fragments into your eggs, crack them on a flat surface instead of on the edge of the pan.

 - loc 3303 - If the white is really runny or clear, the egg has come from a battery-raised chicken stuck in a cage. The tastiest eggs will also have yolks closer in color to red or orange instead of yellow, which Italians refer to as il rosso.

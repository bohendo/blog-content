#  Time Management for Sys Admins
## by Thomas Limoncelli
---

 - loc 54 - The one-person-cavalry-to-the-rescue fetish is not a sustainable rationale for staying in the profession, but it sure does a good job of initially drawing people into the field.

 - loc 121 - Perfectionism is often overkill and a real time waster. The inventors of the Internet were brilliant at this. They realized they’d never get anywhere if they waited for the underlying communication links to be perfect, and so they developed protocols that worked around imperfections.

 - loc 335 - One “database” for time management information (use one organizer). Conserve your brain power for what’s important (conserve RAM). Develop routines and stick with them (reuse code libraries; don’t reinvent the wheel). Develop habits and mantras (replace runtime calculations with precomputed decisions). Maintain focus during “project time” (be like a kernel semaphore). Manage your social life with the same tools you use for your work life (social life isn’t an optional feature).

 - loc 379 - I know about 10 really good Perl idioms, and I reuse them over and over.

 - loc 379 - I know about 10 really good Perl idioms, and I reuse them over and over. Rarely is a program truly written from scratch.

 - loc 381 - spend less time planning things that are going to happen anyway.

 - loc 385 - At the start of the day, before I’ve even checked my email, I review my to do list and set priorities for the day.

 - loc 389 - Habits are routines you do without having to think. Mantras are mental triggers for rules of thumb.

 - loc 408 - Developing habits and mantras are investments we make so that our brain isn’t cluttered in the long run.

 - loc 412 - it is the hectic days when you are most tempted to skip the five minutes of planning, yet it is those days that planning is most beneficial. I say to myself, “Trust the process,” and do the planning. I’m always glad I did.

 - loc 414 - When your brain is full of negative or toxic thoughts such as, “I’ll do it later,” or “I’m too busy to stop for five minutes to plan my day,” a mantra has the power to fill your brain with a positive thought, squeezing out the negativity. If you can act during the fleeting moment that the mantra fills your brain, you’ll be taking positive action before the negative thought can return.

 - loc 423 - when memory is being allocated to a task, the kernel locks out all other memory-table access so that this one happens correctly, without multiple processes all trying to modify the allocation tables at the same time. As an SA, you want the same kind of laser focus when you’re working.

 - loc 520 - Part of the brain is used to keep that memory alive. DRAM chips work the same way. They have to keep refreshing their memory or the information disappears.

 - loc 532 - Falling asleep is about letting your brain calm down. How can you calm down if you are expecting it to remember something for tomorrow? You can’t do both at once. Keep a pad of paper and a pen next to your bed. When something is keeping you awake, write it down and try falling asleep again. I bet you’ll be asleep soon.

 - loc 546 - I’ve developed an office cleaning mantra: When in doubt, throw it out. I then follow this three-step plan: File the things that can be filed. Take the unfinished items and put them in a stack to be done soon. Put all the remaining stuff in a large envelope marked, “If I haven’t opened this three months from now, I can throw it out.” Then seal the envelope.

 - loc 553 - When deciding to throw out the envelope I repeat the following mantra: When in doubt, throw it out. If I ever do need it, I can ask the source for a copy.

 - loc 554 - When in doubt, throw it out. If I ever do need it, I can ask the source for a copy.

 - loc 556 - I still have many posters, they just aren’t in my direct view. When I’m sitting at my desk facing my computer, I want blank walls, nothing distracting.

 - loc 570 - Don Aslett has written a number of books about getting rid of clutter both in the home and in the office. My favorite is Clutter’s Last Stand: It’s Time to De-Junk Your Life!

 - loc 586 - Good tasks to multitask are “hurry up and wait” tasks, such as downloading a large file, compiling a large program, or waiting for a long backup or restore to complete. Anything else shouldn’t be multitasked. Do one task at a time well rather than many things at once poorly.

 - loc 590 - Be aware of your stress and sleep level. If you are tired or under a lot of stress, multitask less.

 - loc 597 - Organize your windows the same way every time.

 - loc 602 - When writing Perl code, I always use the same three window arrangements: a text editor (wide window, top left), the place where I run/test the program and/or prepare input (narrow window, top right), and the place where I review the output (wide window across the bottom).

 - loc 606 - It drives me crazy to see a junior system administrator who uses too few windows.

 - loc 632 - The first-hour rule is that the first hour of the workday is usually the quietest hour in an office.

 - loc 635 - How do you spend the first hour of the day? I bet you spend it catching up with email and voice mail. Instead of letting these tasks consume your first hour, why not check your email for subject lines that look important (or email that’s from your boss), read those, and then shut off your email reader. Now spend that first hour on a project.

 - loc 640 - I use the open source program Nagios (http://www.nagios.org) to monitor the services I’m responsible for, such as email servers, routers, web servers, etc. When I arrive in the morning, I can look at the summary page and see that all indicators are green and be confident that I can spend my first hour on projects, not worrying that something’s down and I don’t know it.

 - loc 656 - Many parks open an hour earlier than they advertise. If you show up then, you practically have the entire park to yourself. For example, Disneyland varies the opening time throughout the year. There is a phone number to call to find out tomorrow’s opening time. Whatever time this says, show up an hour earlier and you’ll find the gate is open.

 - loc 714 - People not following directions is usually a warning sign that the directions aren’t clear to them, aren’t visible enough, or that the directions don’t work.

 - loc 727 - I write down his request as he watches. I say what I write as I’m writing it. It usually sounds like, “[Person] needs [such and such] by [date].” Then I turn to him and ask, “Did I capture that right?” When he says “yes,” it gives closure to the issue. Having achieved closure, he usually leaves on his own, if I don’t ruin it by saying something to continue the conversation. I’ve found it best to say “Thank you,” while giving a nod. Anything else just reopens the dialog.

 - loc 804 - Make sure the customer sees you record the request so that he has visible confirmation that he isn’t being ignored.

 - loc 902 - Routines give us a way to think once, do many.

 - loc 926 - Eventually, you might actually forget why you established the routine. That’s OK. In fact, it’s a good thing. You don’t have to think about breathing; it’s an autonomic function of the brain. Imagine how distracted you would be if every few seconds you had to stop, recall why breathing is important,

 - loc 947 - If I ask “Should I bring my organizer?” the answer is “Yes.” That has a domino effect that works well. When I’m leaving work, I know to take my organizer. When I’m leaving for work, if my organizer isn’t in my car, I know I have to go into the house to find it.

 - loc 978 - I wanted to be a hands-off manager — the other SAs were all smart, hardworking, and independent. I mostly left everyone alone. However, I soon learned that they felt ignored.

 - loc 978 - wanted to be a hands-off manager — the other SAs were all smart, hardworking, and independent. I mostly left everyone alone. However, I soon learned that they felt ignored.

 - loc 1001 - every Monday and Thursday at 9 a.m., I would do my “walk-around.” I would walk a particular path that went by each person’s office. Their offices were, essentially, in three different clusters, so it was almost like having three mini status meetings. I would stop in, say “hello,” and this would present them with an opportunity to bring up issues.

 - loc 1013 - Develop a routine that solves your problems. Perform the routine on a predictable schedule, and others will plan their schedules around you.

 - loc 1016 - If you are supporting a number of people who are in the same building as you, you can increase customer satisfaction by doing a walk-around once a day to visit customers, talk with them, answer questions, fix problems as you see them, record bigger problems to be worked on later, and so on. If anything, it develops a better rapport with your customers.

 - loc 1028 - they happened. Do not use this technique if you have a problem saying no to people. Part of the reason it worked so well was that my coworker employed something like the delegate, record, do process

 - loc 1028 - Do not use this technique if you have a problem saying no to people. Part of the reason it worked so well was that my coworker employed something like the delegate, record, do process

 - loc 1061 - If it has to be done every day, do it early in the day.

 - loc 1062 - day. After I did my morning planning using The Cycle, I would list “change tapes” as an A priority every day. As a result, there was one less thing weighing heavy on my mind all day, and I could be

 - loc 1066 - Routine #7: During Outages, Communicate to Management

 - loc 1071 - The routine was simple: after an hour, a particular manager (the boss of the chief system administrator) would be notified of an outage, even if it was late at night. The system administrators would then update this person every half hour until the problem was resolved. The manager would notify upper management and customers (if the outage didn’t prevent communication to the customers) so the SAs could focus on solving the problem.

 - loc 1084 - Routine #8: Use Automatic Checks While Performing Certain Tasks

 - loc 1087 - keys do I then close the door. I have a similar ritual when leaving my house.

 - loc 1090 - When I leave a secured room, I make sure I feel my access card-key in my pocket. (Related rule: I never put my card-key down on a table, floor, whatever, even just for a second. It always goes in my pocket and my pocket is where it goes.)

 - loc 1097 - I’m being friendly. I’m really checking for trespassers. Before I disconnect a network cable I set up a continuous “ping” (one per second), which should start failing when I disconnect the correct cable.

 - loc 1098 - Before I disconnect a network cable I set up a continuous “ping” (one per second), which should start failing when I disconnect the correct cable.

 - loc 1099 - disconnect the correct cable. Every time I add a new rule to my firewall, I first set up a demonstration of what I want to block and show that it isn’t blocked. Then I add the firewall rule. Then I repeat the demonstration and show that it now fails.

 - loc 1099 - Every time I add a new rule to my firewall, I first set up a demonstration of what I want to block and show that it isn’t blocked. Then I add the firewall rule. Then I repeat the demonstration and show that it now fails.

 - loc 1116 - When I’m about to edit a configuration file, I always make a backup. I don’t waste time thinking, “Gosh, is this file important enough?” If I have to ask, the answer is “Yes.”

 - loc 1116 - When I’m about to edit a configuration file, I always make a backup. I don’t waste time thinking, “Gosh, is this file important enough?” If I have to ask, the answer is “Yes.” I make backups the same way every time so there is no time wasted figuring out the best way. My system is to copy the file to a file with today’s date on it. For example, named.conf is copied to named.conf-20060120

 - loc 1127 - I write a “things to pack” list on the righthand side of my to do list for the day I’ll be traveling. For weeks (or months) leading up to the trip, anytime I think of something I should bring on the trip I pop open my organizer and write it on that list. Since I always have the organizer with me, I never fail to record an idea. When I pack, I check off the items as they go into my suitcase.

 - loc 1145 - Relationships require maintenance and are also similar to gardening (they grow if you work diligently, starve if they are ignored, and die if they get too much attention). There are four groups of people

 - loc 1146 - There are four groups of people you need to maintain relationships with: your customers (or your single point of contact for each customer group), your staff (who report to you), your peers, and your boss(es). Do you routinely touch base with each of them? The key to networking (the career kind, not the data kind) is to maintain relationships throughout the year, not just when you are looking for a new job. Schedule lunch once a month

 - loc 1152 - The next time you find yourself in a bind because you forgot something, develop a routine to prevent future occurrences.

 - loc 1160 - Some people complain that they never have time for training. Others schedule one training class a year

 - loc 1235 - Write down every request, every time. My brain feels a little insulted by this lack of trust. When someone asks me to do something my brain starts yelling, “I’ll remember it! Put down that PDA, Tom! Trust me this time!”

 - loc 1309 - The elements we need to make a good system are: Calendar. A place to record recurring meetings, appointments, holidays, and so on. Life-goals list. A few blank pages to keep our long term goals and other notes. A day-by-day section. For each day we have: To do list. A prioritized list just for that day. Schedule. An hour-by-hour schedule for that day.

 - loc 1326 - There are four parts in our organizer: 365 to do lists per year. We’re going to have one to do list for each day of the year. Today’s to do list records the tasks you need to do today. If you know something needs to be done on a particular day, write it on that to do list. Items left over at the end of the day will be moved to the next day’s list. (If you use a PAA, you’ll only need to keep the next month’s worth of sheets with you. Otherwise, it will be difficult to carry!) Today’s schedule. Each day we’ll plan our day in one-hour increments. An appointment calendar. This will be used to record all of our appointments, meetings, social plans, and so on. Events that are further in the future than the current month are written on the calendar until they can be transferred to a particular day’s schedule . Notes. Our organizer will also be used to store other notes and lists. For example, in Chapter 7, we’ll create lists of short- and long-term plans.

 - loc 1335 - The Cycle goes like this: each day starts by investing 10 minutes to plan my day. The planning process is simple: Create today’s schedule. On today’s schedule I block out time for all my meetings and appointments. All these events should already be listed on my calendar (I cover how this happens in Chapter 6). I count how many hours are remaining. Those are my work hours for the day. Create today’s to do list . On today’s to do list, I have a list of all the to do items I have on my plate for that day. These to do items are culled from phone calls, meetings, my calendar, our request-tracking system, and the previous day’s to do list. Prioritize and reschedule. For each item, I estimate how much time the item will take to accomplish. I total the time estimates. If the total time is more than my total work hours, I move individual items to the next day’s list. We’ll talk about techniques for selecting what to move later. Work the plan. I spend the day working on the tasks in my list and attending meetings/appointments. I stay focused. When something is complete, I mark it with an X. Finish the day. At the end of the day, I move all the unfinished tasks to the next day’s list. I mark the items that were moved with a hyphen. Leave the office. Now I can leave the office. I am happy with the knowledge that every item on my list was managed — it was either done or moved to the next day. Nothing was forgotten. Repeat. The next day The Cycle starts over again. Each day’s to do list comes prepopulated with items moved from previous days.

 - loc 1402 - Planning your day takes 10 minutes. Email can wait. “What if there is an emergency and someone emailed me about it?” Small emergencies can wait 10 minutes. Big emergencies are usually signaled by nonemail notifications, such as smoke and fire

 - loc 1551 - You’ve managed every item on your list. No, they aren’t all completed, but they were managed. Sometimes managing an item means making sure it got the appropriate amount of attention; for low-priority items, that means they were moved to tomorrow. The important thing is that they were not forgotten.

 - loc 1562 - You should start each day by checking your calendar for any appointments and filling them into your day’s schedule.

 - loc 1568 - They were not as important as the tasks you had to do yesterday, so you recorded them directly onto the first to do list that you thought was realistic, which happened to be today’s (Tuesday’s). This is in addition to the tasks that you managed yesterday by placing them on today’s to do list.

 - loc 1588 - used Tickets as a time holder for those moments in the day when I needed to work on tickets because one of them had become an unexpected priority.

 - loc 1588 - used Tickets as a time holder for those moments in the day when

 - loc 1588 - I used Tickets as a time holder for those moments in the day when I needed to work on tickets because one of them had become an unexpected priority.

 - loc 1727 - The wrong question to ask, and I know this because I used it unsuccessfully for years, is, “Do you need anything else from me?”

 - loc 1733 - when it seems like everything is done, I ask the magic question: “Can you tell me what date it will arrive?” Suddenly it clicks in the salesperson’s brain to tell me that I really am done or to list the roadblocks:

 - loc 1733 - when it seems like everything is done, I ask the magic question: “Can you tell me what date it will arrive?” Suddenly it clicks in the salesperson’s brain to tell me that I really am done or to list the roadblocks: the product isn’t available until next spring, or that while I’ve filled out the credit application, he hasn’t submitted it to his finance department. These are both real examples.

 - loc 1749 - Personal tasks can be managed using the same system. By using one system for both work and nonwork tasks, you get more practice at using The Cycle,

 - loc 1764 - Sure, the daily to do list helps me think about what I’m doing today, but with a big calendar, I could see the big picture.

 - loc 1769 - The Cycle uses the calendar part of your organizer for three primary purposes. First, to block out time for events and meetings that are further in the future than today’s schedule. Second, to list any reminders or milestones such as birthdays and anniversaries. Finally, if you use a PAA, the calendar is where you can record to do items that are further in the future than your current daily filler paper permits.

 - loc 1800 - The key to never missing a meeting is this: always use your calendar. Write down all your appointments; don’t commit to an appointment until you’ve checked your calendar for conflicts.

 - loc 1811 - The excuse I made to myself for not checking my calendar was that I was too embarrassed to say to someone, “Please wait a moment while I get my calendar.” I had an irrational fear that asking people to wait for me was a huge burden on them. Of course, it wasn’t, and the hassle of asking someone to reschedule was an even bigger burden

 - loc 1829 - Even if your lateness is embarrassing, in this age of ubiquitous cell phones, there’s no excuse for not calling.

 - loc 1842 - Being on time for a party is as important to me as finishing a project on deadline.

 - loc 1855 - Users of Unix systems such as Mac OS X, BSD, Debian Linux, and HP Tru64 Unix have the “leave” command to alert them when to leave for an appointment.

 - loc 1856 - Unix/Linux users will find it useful to enable the “at” service and use it to send email to your cell phone at a certain time:

 - loc 1868 - record them when I RSVP. I even record them when I so that I don’t accidentally repeat my rejection.)

 - loc 1868 - Party invites. (I record them when I RSVP. I even record them when I so that I don’t accidentally repeat my rejection.)

 - loc 1884 - I keep a weekly, monthly, and yearly list of reminders in my PAA. On every Monday, I read the weekly sheet and fill in any items for the remaining week. On the first of each month, I read the monthly sheet and fill in this month’s commitments.

 - loc 1884 - I keep a weekly, monthly, and yearly list of reminders in my PAA. On every Monday, I read the weekly sheet and fill in any items for the remaining week. On the first of each month, I read the monthly sheet and fill in this month’s commitments. On the first day of the year, I fill in the yearly items.

 - loc 1946 - cycles. I love working in cyclic industries. It makes planning things a lot easier. In fact, when I’m not in a cyclic industry, I try to find the

 - loc 1946 - I love working in cyclic industries. It makes planning things a lot easier. In fact, when I’m not in a cyclic industry, I try to find the unofficial cycle, or, when possible, move the company into a cycle.

 - loc 2018 - You can make a goal significantly more concrete by answering these questions in each goal statement: What do I want to achieve? When do I want to have achieved it? Everyone forgets the when. It’s easy to never begin if you don’t set a deadline.

 - loc 2119 - On the first day of the month, every month, take a moment to plan your goals. Close your office door (or go to a quiet place) and do the following: Goal review. Review and update your goal list. Cross out any completed goals. If you’ve jotted down any new goals since the last goal review, decide if they still sound like good ideas. If they do, prioritize them. Evaluate your prioritization of existing goals vis-à-vis the new goals you’ve added. Step review. Review and update your next steps list. As steps are marked “done,” schedule later steps into your to do lists, as before.

 - loc 2125 - try to sprinkle them into Mondays so that when I plan my week, I can make room for them, sliding them to a better day if needed.

 - loc 2125 - I try to sprinkle them into Mondays so that when I plan my week, I can make room for them, sliding them to a better day if needed.

 - loc 2125 - I try to sprinkle them into Mondays so that when I plan my week, I can make room for them, sliding them to a better day if needed. How can you remember to do this? Set a repeated event in your PDA called “Goal & Next Step Review.” Have it repeat on the first of every month or the first Monday of every month. Now you’ll always have a reminder to do this process.

 - loc 2125 - I try to sprinkle them into Mondays so that when I plan my week, I can make room for them, sliding them to a better day if needed. How can you remember to do this? Set a repeated event in your PDA called “Goal & Next Step Review.” Have it repeat on the first of every month or the first Monday of every month.

 - loc 2158 - because of the way you move items you couldn’t complete to the following day, it’s common for older items to bubble to the top of the list. Getting these older items done is a great way to start a day.

 - loc 2166 - Doing your to do items in the order they appear is a great way to avoid procrastination. To quote the Nike slogan, “Just do it.” If your list is short enough that you can do all the items in one day, then this scheme makes even more sense.

 - loc 2269 - It’s very tempting to pick out the fun projects, or the politically safe projects, or the projects that are the obvious next steps based on past projects. Ignore those temptations and find the projects that will have the biggest positive impact on your organization’s goals.

 - loc 2310 - Make sure your boss knows where you want to be two, five, or ten years from now.

 - loc 2315 - Once a year you should discuss, in a private one-on-one meeting, where you want your career to go.

 - loc 2328 - Solve Problems at the Right Level Don’t debate technical issues with vice presidents, and don’t solve a political issue with technology.

 - loc 2348 - I’ve had a number of bosses who surprised me when, privately, I asked them what their goals were and how I could help them meet those goals. The way I phrased my query was something like: “What metrics does your boss use to evaluate your performance? If I know how you are measured, I can contribute to the team more effectively by keeping those goals in mind.”

 - loc 2349 - The way I phrased my query was something like: “What metrics does your boss use to evaluate your performance? If I know how you are measured, I can contribute to the team more effectively by keeping those goals in mind.”

 - loc 2420 - that causes stress, it is how we react to what happens to us. I’ve found Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy (Collins) and The Feeling Good Handbook (Plume) to be extremely helpful and highly regarded books in the area of managing stress in productive ways.

 - loc 2421 - I’ve found Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy (Collins) and The Feeling Good Handbook (Plume) to be extremely helpful and highly regarded books in the area of managing stress in productive ways.

 - loc 2429 - I’m not recommending smoking, but I do encourage you to go outside every couple of hours, stretch your legs, and get some perspective.

 - loc 2435 - When I feel overloaded, I remind myself about the techniques for to do list management in Chapter 5. I close my office door (or steal a conference room), get some peace, and focus on The Cycle techniques. Soon, I realize that what got me feeling overloaded was that I was skipping steps. I go through the steps and plan the remainder of my day, moving to do items to the next day, and so on. It feels good to manage all of my tasks.

 - loc 2436 - realize that what got me feeling overloaded was that I was skipping steps. I go through the steps and plan the remainder of my day, moving to do items to the next day, and so on. It feels good to manage all of my tasks.

 - loc 2436 - I realize that what got me feeling overloaded was that I was skipping steps. I go through the steps and plan the remainder of my day, moving to do items to the next day, and so on. It feels good to manage all of my tasks. When I’m really overloaded, that doesn’t work, and I have to seek a higher power, most particularly my boss. A good boss can help prioritize your workload when you are overloaded.

 - loc 2451 - When I’m super-stressed, I’m not able to recognize that this is the exact time to stop what I’m doing and destress. I once had an arrangement with a coworker where we had a code word we would use that would mean, “You’re too stressed to see how stressed you are.” It was a code word so that it could be said in front of others without embarrassment. He did it for me and I did it for him. It was very helpful.

 - loc 2479 - when you postpone taking time off, you become a pain in the ass to everyone in the office, and we don’t like working with you.

 - loc 2495 - When I take a real vacation I have to coordinate to have my VPN access shut off, or I will not be able to prevent myself from reading email. It’s a sickness.

 - loc 2572 - Postponing vacation time is like postponing brushing your teeth. It may seem convenient to skip it now, but in the long term it is not healthy.

 - loc 2574 - good SAs assume that a truck may hit them tomorrow and the company should be able to continue in their absence. Taking a long vacation is one way to test the coverage plan

 - loc 2589 - To keep your inbox clean, you need to have a plan for what you’re going to do with every email message you receive. Each possibility has to end with “delete the message,”

 - loc 2589 - To keep your inbox clean, you need to have a plan for what you’re going to do with every email message you receive. Each possibility has to end with “delete the message,” or your inbox will start to fill up.

 - loc 2612 - Once a month I evaluate the lists I’m subscribed to and unsubscribe from one of them. This

 - loc 2612 - Once a month I evaluate the lists I’m subscribed to and unsubscribe from one of them.

 - loc 2617 - If you aren’t sure if an email list is useful, it isn’t.

 - loc 2626 - My goal is to touch each email only once. By touch, I mean deal with it and send it to its final resting place.

 - loc 2626 - My goal is to touch each email only once. By touch, I mean deal with it and send it to its final resting place. If I don’t have time to read a message, I let it sit unread.

 - loc 2641 - I also receive copies on my cell phone that mention lunch, food, dinner, the word “urgent,” or anything that comes from my boss, my boss’s boss, my significant other, and a few other important people. It not only helps me focus (I’m not checking my email all the time), but it helps me not miss the really important emails.

 - loc 2644 - If your email server permits you to reach a Unix/Linux command line, there is a good chance you can use procmail (http://www.procmail.org) for your server-side filtering. I’m such a fan of procmail that I often tell people, “If you aren’t using procmail, you’re working too hard.”

 - loc 2659 - “When in doubt, throw it out.” If I discover that I need that information a few days later, I can find it in my trash folder. If I need it much later, I can go to the original source or find some poor fool who spends his time meticulously filing every message he receives.

 - loc 2666 - The email that I do save goes into one of two folders: Save and Receipts. If it is something documenting a financial exchange, I put it in the Receipts folder. Otherwise, it goes in my Save folder.

 - loc 2693 - Some email requires delegating a task to someone else. I always cc the person who made the request so she knows who it has been delegated to.

 - loc 2756 - I could whip through articles like you wouldn’t believe. Seriously — other Usenet aficionados would watch me and ask for tips. Then one day I came up with the most amazing optimization to the process. I decided to stop reading Usenet all together. I gained a couple of hours each day. The ultimate process improvement is to eliminate the process. Eliminate, don’t automate.

 - loc 2786 - Rule of thumb: set an alarm before doing something “just for a minute.”

 - loc 2886 - think TV is great. In the last 15 years, it has gone from being a total wasteland to a wasteland filled with pearls.

 - loc 2886 - I think TV is great. In the last 15 years, it has gone from being a total wasteland to a wasteland filled with pearls.

 - loc 3006 - Your boss may have her reasons for wanting you to maintain documentation, but I recommend that your inspiration be something different — selfish. Build documentation repositories that serve you and your time management needs, not the seemingly irrelevant needs of your boss or quality department. Specifically, SAs need two repositories: Customer-facing repository . Documents that you want users of your network to have access to, such as the policies and procedures they should follow to get service. Internal IT repository. The info you need internally to help you do your job, such as contact info for vendors, written instructions for tasks, and so on.

 - loc 3018 - I suggest two repositories because one needs to be freely accessible by all customers, while the other may contain sensitive information that should be restricted for security reasons.

 - loc 3028 - You can eliminate the fear of the repository never being done by declaring it to be a living document.

 - loc 3077 - Every time I deal with a vendor, I use this page to contact them, even if the info is also in my personal address book. That way I know the page is up-to-date in the central repository. If I find it has become out-of-date, I update it right then and there.

 - loc 3101 - now that it’s documented, I have a hope of foisting it off on someone else. In Chapter 2, I talked about delegating. A good document repository is an excellent way to make a task easier to delegate.

 - loc 3103 - I document all the tasks that I hate to do, which I would give to an assistant if I had one. The next time there is a hiring opportunity, I can refer to the repository for a list of what to include in the job description for my new assistant: create accounts, change backup tapes, fix common printer problems, and so on. Gosh, isn’t it an amazing coincidence that those things are already well-documented and ready for someone else to take over?

 - loc 3227 - Adam Moskowitz, a well-known SA, tells me that his litmus test for whether something is “automated enough” is that he can delegate the task to someone less skilled. For example, once, he automated his company’s disk backups to the point that the company secretary was able to take over the daily tape-changing tasks.

 - loc 3288 - one of the benefits of documenting a procedure is that writing down the steps is the key to being able to automate something. I wasn’t kidding. In fact, when I don’t have time to automate something, I write the step-by-step procedure on my Wiki telling someone else how to do the task. When I do that, I’ve accomplished two things. First, I’ve contributed to the documentation of how our system works. Second, I’ve actually performed the first step of automating the process!

 - loc 3374 - Don’t try to turn one OS into another. Aliases are great, but don’t overdo it. I’ve often seen people developing dozens of aliases so that they can type DOS commands in Unix. I think this is a bad idea. You’re never going to learn Unix that way, and the next time you are on someone else’s machine and don’t have access to those aliases, you’ll be stuck.

 - loc 3435 - after editing /etc/aliases (part of sendmail, Postfix, and various mail-transport-agent packages), you must run the newaliases command. That’s pretty easy to remember, right? After editing Postfix’s transports file, should you run the newtransports command? No, that would be too obvious. You must run postmap transports. And there is the m4 command to run after editing .m4 files, and so on and so on. Who has time to remember which command is used after which file is edited? Details like that are what computers are for. make to the rescue! You might think of make as a programming tool — the program you run when compiling software. In reality, it lets you set up any kind of relationship involving the need to run a command to update one file if another changes.

 - loc 3446 - you read the first two chapters of most books on make, you’ll know 99 percent of what you need to for most system administration tasks and 10 times more than what your coworkers know.)

 - loc 3452 - The recipe begins with the file that is going to be created, then a colon, and then it lists the files needed to build the main file.

 - loc 3457 - A real-world example helps: aliases.db: aliases newaliases @echo Done updating aliases This code means that if aliases is changed, regenerate aliases.db using the command newaliases. Then the recipe outputs “Done updating aliases” to announce its success.

 - loc 3505 - I said that each recipe begins with the file that is going to be created, followed by a colon, and then it lists the files that make up the main file. make doesn’t know whether those files really make up the file to be created. There’s no way it could tell. Those items listed after

There’s no way it could tell. Those items listed after the colon are really just dependencies that must be up-to-date.

 - loc 3507 - Those items listed after the colon are really just dependencies that must be up-to-date.

 - loc 3538 - By carefully constructing the recipes with proper dependencies, and touching *.done files where required, make will do the absolute minimal amount of work to bring the system up-to-date:

 - loc 3562 - Many complicated procedures are reduced to: Edit the appropriate file. Type make. make can be the ultimate tool for bringing together many smaller automated processes.

 - loc 3576 - Any file that is automatically pushed to other servers should always have a comment at the top of the file warning other system administrators where the file came from and where to edit it.

 - loc 3582 - There are many programs called xed, but this one can be found on http://www.nightcoder.com/code/xed. This program calls whatever editor you usually use ($EDITOR can be set to vi, pico, emacs, and so on) after locking the file. It is a must for any site that has multiple system administrators working on the same machine. If you are using RCS to track changes to a file, it does all the “check in” and “check out” work for you. This gives you infinite undo and a logfile of who changed what.

 - loc 3613 - The $* in the makeimage1 script means “any items on the command line.” So, if you typed: $ makeimage1 cdrom/ then the $* would be replaced by cdrom/.

 - loc 3632 - args='getopt ab: $*' if [ $? != 0 ] then echo "Usage: command [-a] [-b file.txt] file1 file2 ..." exit -1 fi set -- $args for i do case "$i" in -a) FLAGA=1 shift ;; -b) ITEMB="$2" ; shift shift ;; --) shift; break ;; esac done

 - loc 3689 - Think Unix (Que) is an excellent book for learning how to link Unix/Linux tools to make bigger commands.

 - loc 3795 - in awk you can type $NF when you want the last field on a line.

 - loc 3831 - Writing the GUI for an application can be 90 percent of the battle. Here’s a lazy way to make the user interface: maintain the data in Microsoft Excel, but write a macro that uploads the data to a server for processing.

 - loc 3876 - In Unix/Linux, there is a program called sudo that lets system administrators give a person the ability to run a command as another user. It is very restrictive, requiring the system administrator to configure it to specify exactly which user(s) can run which command(s) as which other user.

 - loc 3890 - I like to build three layers when I automate something for other people: Layer 1. A program that does the basic task. Layer 2. A program that the user will run, with sudo, that collects her input, validates it, makes sure she isn’t trying to do anything fishy, and then calls the first program. Layer 3. A more user-friendly way to access these previous layers, such as a web interface or menu program.

 - loc 3944 - On Unix/Linux systems, especially servers, standardize on having a Makefile in /etc that automates common tasks such as reindexing aliases, cloning data, and so on.

 - loc 3950 - When writing code to let users do privileged operations, be extremely careful. Build on security tools that already exist and have good credibility, such as sudo. Use a permission table to explain to management who will have access to what. It is their job to manage risk and your job to help them understand

Use a permission table to explain to management who will have access to what. It is their job to manage risk and your job to help them understand the issues. Get approval before you deploy the system.

 - loc 3976 - Please don’t use your new-found free time to pack more time wasters into your life. I have a better idea. Use this new-found free time to fight injustice.

 - loc 3996 - Call your parents and other important people in your life. Schedule a periodic reminder to call your parents and block out a good hour for the conversation. They’ll appreciate it, and you’ll appreciate it even more when they’re gone.

 - loc 4002 - Help a non-profit that fights injustice, web edition. Find their web site and offer to help maintain it. Better yet, install a Content Management System or blog software so that they can maintain it without your help.

 - loc 4008 - School board seats often go uncontested, or can be won with a campaign budget of a few hundred dollars.

 - loc 4010 - Run for public office. The fact that there are so many ill-conceived laws governing technology is not going to change until enough geeks run for office.

 - loc 4012 - Fighting injustice is like dropping acorns wherever you go. Sometimes, you return to a place and find something wonderful growing; other times, there is nothing. Most of the time, however, you’ll never know how much you’ve changed the world or how many people’s lives you’ve touched. You just have to trust that it was worth it. Peace. — Tom Limoncelli

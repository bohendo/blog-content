#  Jiu-Jitsu on the Brain

 - loc 453 - A balanced game will allow you to attack from both sides, making your skills more complete, more effective, and essentially doubling your techniques. Always drill both sides. Balance is good.

 - loc 462 - The difference between what you know and what you are is the ability to do without thinking, and that only comes with repetition.

 - loc 508 - Chances are you probably won’t be choked out too often, if ever; it’s happened to me only three times in fourteen years, and all those times I was being stubborn or stupid or both.

 - loc 527 - I see a chance for a single leg and I think “What if I shoot for a single and he sprawls” by the time I’m finished with that thought the opportunity has passed. I’ve missed it.

 - loc 537 - “What if he sweeps me and I look like a fool?” What if he doesn’t? The point is you can’t be afraid of the What Ifs. A what if is only a speculation and it’s usually a bad one, a negative thought, but we have to realize that there are positive What Ifs that balance the equation. So the best thing to do is to not even ask the question. You see a good opportunity to shoot a single—shoot a single! Focus on the shot not the outcome. Don’t think about it, do it.

 - loc 554 - When you chase your opponent, you sacrifice something. Chasing reeks of desperation. I’m not saying don’t be aggressive if that’s your style, I’m just saying don’t be out of control; don’t charge in recklessly.

 - loc 556 - calculating and confident; let your opponent come to you. Invite him closer with your relaxed state and then when he’s within distance, spring the trap. Do not sacrifice your base and calmness by chasing your opponent.

 - loc 561 - The problem with heel hooks and beginners is that the heel hook is deceptive; it feels like you can muscle your way out of it, but you can’t. As soon as it starts to hurt, it’s too late—you’re hurt (quite possibly in more than one place). The heel hook threatens the hip joint, the knee, and the ankle. Don’t mess around with the heel hook. If someone has you in one, tap (unless of course you like limping).

 - loc 578 - If you want to get better at jiu-jitsu, roll with the big guy, you know, the big man, the three-hundred pounder that everyone seems to avoid accept the best guys in the class–how do you think those guys got so good? They weren’t afraid to roll with the guys who were bigger than they are. Anyone who you think can kick your ass, that’s the person you should roll with.

 - loc 595 - The rule for your hips is simple: if you’re on the bottom, you need to create space; if you’re on the top, you need to take away space. You create space by moving the hips as far away from your opponent’s hips as possible. You do the opposite if you’re on top, you close any distance, you pressure down; you control your opponent’s hips with your own.

 - loc 610 - Train with your eyes closed to develop a greater sensitivity to touch.

 - loc 617 - The good news is, you soon realize when to hold and how to hold, and burning your grip becomes rare. Once you really get going, you discover that using your hands in general isn’t really a necessity and that’s when you start to see the power and beauty of jiu-jitsu.

 - loc 622 - You should get in the habit of keeping your arms short when you train; keep them close to your body; don’t reach and grab—have alligator arms.

 - loc 630 - If someone is rubbing your philtrum, say from the back, it’s almost impossible to keep your head down, making it a lot easier to sink in a rear naked choke.

 - loc 653 - is a mistake to collect new techniques without trying to master the ones you already know.

 - loc 653 - It is a mistake to collect new techniques without trying to master the ones you already know.

 - loc 711 - Jiu-jitsu will remind you of how wonderfully your body used to work until you injured yourself.

 - loc 765 - You shouldn’t test because of the status a belt color might carry, you should test because your preparation for the test will help you focus on a chunk of specific information–information that you can perfect before you move on to more advanced techniques.

 - loc 780 - Yes, you can get a couple points ahead and stall out a victory, but to me that’s not really winning–that’s not losing (It’s a victory I guess, but it’s definitely not decisive.) You should always try and finish your opponent; who cares how many points they’re up on you? If you submit them, you leave the mat victorious.

 - loc 847 - hold on. That’s it. Meat Heads can’t relax; it’s not in their nature. To a Meat Head, a stale mate is a loss, so a lot of times an overly aggressive guy will tire himself out trying to mash you. Defend, “cook” him, let him work, let him get tired, and when he’s good and frustrated, submit him. That’s when he’ll make a mistake; when he’s tired and frustrated. When you go against a Meat Head: hold on, be patient, and look for your opportunity.

 - loc 917 - Composure is being afraid, but being able to pull your shit together. We can’t be like pit bulls all the time. Sometimes we’re afraid, but we must be composed. We cannot put our tail between our legs or piss all over ourselves just because some giant German shepherd is snapping at us.

 - loc 1005 - So Brian, out of the competition due to his shoulder, recently knocked unconscious, but still a gentleman and sportsman, offered his opponent his own West Side T-shirt, the one he had worn to the competition. I watched Brian take off his shirt and hand it to the dude who just knocked him unconscious and separated his shoulder (illegally I might add).  That act of kindness was one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen at a tournament. Brian understands competition. He sees people instead of victory or medals or podiums. He understands the nature of competition and he doesn’t let the desire to win overpower his humanity. Brian left that tournament without a medal or his shirt, but he still left victorious.

 - loc 1019 - Brad has limited use of his legs, and he adds, his butt cheeks (which he points out are very important in one’s movement). He’s a funny man. I noticed rather quickly that he never gave himself an out when it came to a technique. If he couldn’t do it, he would work on it with a partner until he could make the technique fit his body–make it fit his situation (or he would figure out some way to turn it into a neck crank). This to me is the spirit of Helio–the modification and alteration of jiu-jitsu so that it is effective for one’s own situation, one’s own circumstance.

 - loc 1037 - I am starting to see jiu-jitsu as a path to understanding, not only of myself, or of people, but of the world—of the universe. I think that happens to people that study one thing for a long time. Think of monks, or Albert Einstein, or Rabbit Kekai (an 81 year old surfer from Honolulu). I think that over time that thing that we do, whether it’s religion, physics, surfing, jiu-jitsu or whatever; that thing will begin to reveal the secrets of the universe to us.

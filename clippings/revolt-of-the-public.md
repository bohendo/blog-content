#  Revolt of The Public

## by Martin Gurri

 - loc 200 - The docile mass audience, so easily persuaded by advertisers and politicians, had been a monopolist’s fantasy which disintegrated at first contact with alternatives.

 - loc 333 - The dilemma works this way. For security reasons, dictators must control and restrict communications to a minimum. To make their rule legitimate, however, they need prosperity, which can only be attained by the open exchange of information. Choose.

 - loc 1098 - The most promising way forward, it seems to me, is to follow N. N. Taleb’s “subtractive knowledge” method of analyzing complex questions. Rather than assert what the public is, I explain what the public is not. This resembles the sculptor’s approach of chipping away at the stone until a likeness emerged,

 - loc 1173 - when everyone is king, power must be divorced from legitimacy.

 - loc 1255 - the power to react made it dangerous to autocrats. East Germany in 1953, Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Poland in 1980 saw the public cash in the ultimate choice: life-and-death revolutions against communist regimes. By 1989, all the propaganda in the world couldn’t save those regimes from being swept away. By 1991, the mother ship—the Soviet Union and its communist party—had foundered.

 - loc 1303 - If the public can be said to re-create the crowd into a form of communication, it is equally true that such a crowd, once convincingly expressed, will create its own public.

 - loc 1476 - The manifesto drafted for that original protest was a marvel of nonpartisan, non-ideological inclusiveness: We are normal ordinary people. We are like you: people who get up in the morning to study, to work or to look for work, people with family and friends. People who work hard every day to make a living and win a future for those around us. Some of us consider ourselves more progressive, others more conservative. Some are believers, others not. Some have well-defined ideologies, others consider ourselves apolitical . . . But all of us are worried and outraged by the political, economic, and social landscape we see around us. By the corruption of the politicians, businessmen, bankers . .

 - loc 1678 - nihilism. By this word I mean the will to destruction, including self-destruction, for its own sake. I mean, specifically, the negation of democracy and capitalism, with a frivolous disregard for the consequences.

 - loc 2142 - Like money and marriage, legitimacy exists objectively because vast numbers of the public agree, subjectively, that it does exist.

 - loc 2142 - Like money and marriage, legitimacy exists objectively because vast numbers of the public agree, subjectively, that it does exist. If enough people change their minds, the authorizing magic is lost. The process is slow and invisible to analysts, but, as I have noted, the tipping point comes suddenly

 - loc 2359 - Scientists today work in teams, and the subject matter can be so specialized that only a handful of individuals will be able to understand and review the literature. Authors and reviewers can trade places in a chummy circle of mutual admiration and protection. In extreme cases, this constriction of knowledge leads to what one analyst has called “research cartels,” which actively stifle minority or unorthodox views.

 - loc 2369 - The distance between professional and amateur—Einstein, let us recall, was one of the latter—grew immensely, and the usual barriers were erected to keep out trespassers from the inner temple of authority. The cost of scientific journals, for example, became prohibitive,

 - loc 2369 - The distance between professional and amateur—Einstein, let us recall, was one of the latter—grew immensely, and the usual barriers were erected to keep out trespassers from the inner temple of authority. The cost of scientific journals, for example, became prohibitive, so that only institutions could afford a subscription.

 - loc 3054 - I have treated the limitation of government as a function of the limits of human knowledge, not of ideological preference, and in this approach I have stuck close to Paul Ormerod’s brilliantly researched and happily titled book, Why Most Things Fail.

 - loc 3362 - High modernist government was an austere prophet, demanding the destruction of the muddled present to make room for the perfect future. Late modernist government is more like a kindly uncle, passing out chocolate chip cookies to his favorite nieces and nephews. He doesn’t wish to transform them. He just wants them to be happy—most particularly, with him.

 - loc 5609 - “This is, at bottom, a battle over the truth,” Kurtz concludes.94 But it’s really a battle for dominance, fought on a darkling plain where truth, when encountered, is used strictly as a weapon.

 - loc 5688 - When it comes to voter fraud, the size of his crowds, the unemployment and murder rates, and on many, many other topics,

 - loc 5688 - When it comes to voter fraud, the size of his crowds, the unemployment and murder rates, and on many, many other topics, Trump can’t resist the urge to bend reality to his theme.

 - loc 5703 - The elite vision of a post-truth era ultimately rests on a fallacy. It assumes that there was once a time when voters acted on some sort of rational calculus based on “objective facts,” and were immune to “appeals to emotion and personal belief.”

 - loc 5720 - For the class that rules and speaks on behalf of national institutions to be stripped of authority—to lose the power to persuade—has been a traumatic and terrifying event. As Haidt would expect, the elites have chosen not to question their own worldview: they blame the lies of populists like Trump instead. That is their notion of post-truth.

 - loc 5750 - Another thesis, no less problematic, can account for such odd behavior. The president may just be a creature of our fractured age: he speaks, subjectively and symbolically, from inside a shard of Trumpian truth. In that shallow place, where the world and his will are one, he can invent, at will, an endless supply of reasons for righteous rants.

 - loc 5766 - Nazis become a symbolic judgment on Trump—much as, for Trump, electoral fraud is a symbolic judgment on his enemies. Even if objectively false, both propositions embody truth as it should be. Once that door is open, strange things start to happen.

 - loc 5903 - The recovery of truth requires the restoration of trusted authority. At the moment, that is nowhere in sight.

 - loc 6065 - The public is accustomed to proximity but finds the exercise of power removed an impossible distance away: reasons are never given, questions are never answered, and in this way begins the long, foul rant that is our moment in history.

 - loc 6078 - numbers are unprecedented in human experience. Political

 - loc 6081 - Today’s tastes may run to egalitarianism, but across history and cultures the only way to organize humanity, and get things done, has been through some level of command and control within a formal hierarchy. We are probably hard-wired to respond to this pattern. The pyramid can be made flatter or steeper, and a matrix of informal networks is invariably overlaid on it: but the structural necessity holds.

 - loc 6086 - If my analysis is anywhere close to the mark, the re-formation of liberal democracy, and the recovery of truth, must wait on the emergence of a legitimate elite class.

 - loc 6152 - Humility means that the top of the pyramid looks to the public as a home it will return to rather than a carnivorous species from which to hide.

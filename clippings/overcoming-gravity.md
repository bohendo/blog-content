 - loc 17 - The phenomenon of placing the muscles into short or lengthened states at the edge of their range of motion is termed active insufficiency and passive insufficiency respectively

 - loc 17 - Active tension is the force that we can generate. Passive tension is what occurs when we stretch a muscle out really far to the edge of its range of motion. At this point structures like connective tissues such as ligaments, joint capsules, etc. generate force

 - loc 18 - Open kinetic chain (OKC) exercises are exercises that are performed where the limbs are free to move

 - loc 18 - Most dumbbell exercises are OKC exercises

 - loc 18 - Closed chain exercises (CKC) are exercises that are performed where the limbs are not free to move. Typically, these movements are performed with barbells or bodyweight. Weighted versions of these exercises are squats, deadlifts, the Olympic lifts, etc. where the feet are fixed against the ground. Likewise, almost all bodyweight movements are closed chain

 - loc 18 - Bench and press are exercises with the barbell that are stabilized in space; this represents somewhat of a hybrid between OKC and CKC exercises because you are stabilizing the weight like many OKC exercises, but the hands are also fixed like CKC exercises

 - loc 19 - If your goal is hypertrophy, typically CKC and semi-CKC exercises work best such as compound barbell exercises like the squat, deadlift, bench press, etc. One interesting phenomena is that the press tends to be a better muscle mass builder than the handstand pushup

 - loc 19 - For rehabilitation, we will primarily use OKC exercises because they are very easy to isolate specific weaknesses, target specific structures that need to be strengthened, or improve certain movement patterns

 - loc 22 - 1. Strength and endurance cannot optimally be developed at the same time since they are at opposite ends of the spectrum. 2. Developing maximal strength increases the potential for maximum endurance. 3. Strength takes longer to develop than endurance/conditioning

 - loc 24 - A ‚Äúmotor unit‚Äù is a motor neuron and all of the fibers it innervates or can stimulate to contract

 - loc 24 - Type I fibers are our ‚Äúslow twitch‚Äù fibers and are red in color because of the enormous number of mitochondria that are located within them. They have a high capacity for endurance and are the primary muscle fiber type developed by endurance sports. These fibers have the least potential for hypertrophy

 - loc 24 - Type IIb fibers are our ‚Äúfast twitch‚Äù fibers, which are white in color. They fatigue very rapidly because they can only use anaerobic metabolism to supply their energy, but they also contract very rapidly and are the main type of fiber developed in power and strength sports. These have the most potential for hypertrophy

 - loc 24 - Type IIa fibers are our ‚Äúadaptable‚Äù fibers that are pink in color. They have characteristics of each of the type I and type IIb fibers. Therefore, the type of training can bias these fibers towards either the strength and power side or the endurance side

 - loc 24 - Motor units are categorized into a continuum similar to the muscle fiber types. At one end we have low threshold motor units (LTMUs) and at the other we have high threshold motor units (HTMUs

 - loc 24 - Motor units are categorized into a continuum similar to the muscle fiber types. At one end we have low threshold motor units (LTMUs) and at the other we have high threshold motor units (HTMUs). In general, the LTMUs correspond to the motor units that innervate the type I slow twitch fibers, and HTMUs correspond to motor units that innervate type IIb fast twitch fibers. Between those are the type IIa muscle fibers in the middle

 - loc 24 - LTMUs are active when we want to lift a small object such as a cup, but HTMUs are only activated when we need to use most of our strength such as in a near max effort deadlift

 - loc 25 - É± Recruitment ‚ó¶ An increase in the number of motor units being activated for a specific movement. ÔÉ± Rate Coding / Firing Rate ‚ó¶ A decrease in the time between each electrochemical signal that is sent to the corresponding musculature, which increases rate of contraction. ÔÉ± Intra-muscular Coordination (Synchronization) ‚ó¶ A decrease in the amount of time between motor units firing and working together. ÔÉ± Inter-muscular Coordination (Contribution) ‚ó¶ How effectively timed the different, contributing muscles to a movement are fired. ÔÉ± Antagonist Disinhibition ‚ó¶ Reduction of resistance from muscles opposite of those performing the movement. ÔÉ± Growth and Pruning ‚ó¶ Additional neural connections will grow specific to the training that induces it. The body also prunes connections that it does not need or are not used

 - loc 25 - The nervous system has limiters on the amount of force we can produce. Golgi tendon organs in our musculotendinous junctions provide inhibitory feedback as the forces against those tissues increase. Fortunately, with training the inhibitory effect on this can be reduced which increases recruitment of muscle fibers. This effect is greatly enhanced and maximized around then 85-90% 1 RM threshold.

 - loc 25 - Firing rate increases begin to occur after all motor units in a muscle are recruited

 - loc 26 - Rate coding/firing matters very little for a strength-based program, but is useful to note for those seeking hypertrophy. Muscles that rely more on rate coding tend to be composed of more slow-twitch fibers. Therefore, they respond better to higher repetitions. Thus, the core, forearms, calves, and other highly rate coded muscles, use higher repetitions more often for growth

 - loc 26 - Antagonist disinhibition can improve contraction of the muscle. This is usually done by extensively stretching the opposing muscle you are planning to work beforehand

 - loc 26 - Skills and exercises that are repeated often show the greatest increases in recruitment and synchronization

 - loc 27 - In bodyweight training this is analogous to working with supramaximal eccentrics and isometrics. All of these are very taxing on the CNS

 - loc 27 - The studies indicate that isometrics and eccentrics tend to recruit HTMUs right off the bat to sustain their contractions

 - loc 27 - the occluded blood flow to the muscle and greater time under tension also means that they are also biasing towards metabolic slow twitch adaptations. They will tend to be used by us mainly in supramaximal contractions (for the eccentrics) and near maximal contractions for the isometrics, so it will bias it more towards the HTMU adaptation which is favorable

 - loc 28 - When a motor unit that is connected to a fast twitch fiber is transplanted onto a slow twitch fiber, the slow twitch fiber morphologically changes to a fast twitch fiber

 - loc 28 - Myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic hypertrophy are the two types of hypertrophy that occur primarily in HTMUs and LTMUs respectively. As we talked about above, hypertrophy in HTMUs result primarily from protein breakdown of the actin and myosin proteins that facilitate muscular contractions. Thus, the body starts adding more contractile proteins ‚Äì myofibrils ‚Äì in response to the break down to mitigate it next time. This is the essence of myofibrillar hypertrophy. Conversely, since LTMUs have many mitochondria they fatigue much slower than the fast twitch counterparts. Thus, most of the stress on the cell is metabolic accumulation of muscular acidosis, reactive oxygen species, and free radicals. In response to this stress, the LTMUs add additional proteins and metabolites that draw more water into the cell creating sarcoplasmic hypertrophy

 - loc 30 - There are mainly 3 different pathways in the body that lead to hypertrophy. The first is high tension and fast twitch activation and fatigue. The second is eccentric damage via the popping sarcomere theory and microtrauma. The third is metabolic accumulation, local growth factors, hypoxia, and glycogen depletion based hypertrophy

 - loc 33 - keep the SMART model in mind: ÔÉ± Specific ÔÉ± Measurable ÔÉ± Action-Oriented ÔÉ± Realistic ÔÉ± Time and Resource Constrained

 - loc 34 - A lack of strength will always limit you in all other domains ‚Äì technique, endurance, skill, balance, flexibility (active and passive), agility, coordination, etc. You must be strong in order to excel in all of these other domains. The converse is typically not true

 - loc 34 - I strongly suggest that you keep your goals written in your training journal

 - loc 38 - É± Keeping the shoulders (glenohumeral / scapular articulations) operating optimally is the key to bodyweight strength success

 - loc 38 - É± The shoulder is the lynchpin of the upper body just like the hip is for the lower body

 - loc 38 - our first axiom is: ÔÉ± Keeping the shoulders (glenohumeral / scapular articulations) operating optimally is the key to bodyweight strength success

 - loc 38 - The second axiom builds off of this point: ÔÉ± The shoulder is the lynchpin of the upper body just like the hip is for the lower body

 - loc 39 - É± Any exercise in which the center of mass of the body is moving towards the hands is a pulling exercise ÔÉ± Any exercise in which the center of mass of the body is moving away from the hands is a pushing exercise

 - loc 40 - there is very little ‚Äúelbows out‚Äù in bodyweight strength training

 - loc 40 - bodyweight ‚Äúpushing‚Äùexercises are ‚Äúflexion‚Äù shoulder movements only. That means the elbows will move forward and backward as the arm moves up towards the head rather than out to the side in ‚Äúabduction

 - loc 41 - É± Pushing exercises with the shoulder in an already flexed state. ÔÉ± Pushing exercises with the shoulder in an extended or hyperextended state. In anatomical terms when a shoulder is in a state of ‚Äúflexion‚Äù it is raised up in front of the body if looking at the body from the side. A state of ‚Äúextension‚Äù is moving the opposite way towards the arm at neutral position. A state of ‚Äúhyperextension‚Äù is when the arm is behind the midline of the body

 - loc 42 - Pushing exercises with the shoulder in flexion are primarily horizontal and vertical pushing work such as press handstands, handstand pushups, planche work, most pushup variations, etc. Flexion exercises in extension/hyperextension are exercises where the elbow pass behind the midline of the body and initiate flexion in the concentric phase. These are all dip variations, muscle ups, very deep pushup variations, and some odd exercises such as german hangs or back lever

 - loc 42 - Pulling exercises are divided into two categories: ÔÉ± Pulling exercises when the shoulder is in a state of flexion or adduction. ÔÉ± Pulling exercises when the shoulder is extended or hyperextended

 - loc 43 - Pulling exercises with the shoulder in a state of extension or hyperextension are very few and far between. The most obvious one is the V-sit and manna progression as the hands as being extended backwards away from the the hips while the arms are already located behind the body

 - loc 43 - Pulling exercises which extend the shoulder when it is in a state of flexion or adduction are compromised of most of the vertical pulling variations such as pullups, front lever progressions, and pullup variations

 - loc 44 - proper routine balance is key to avoid these sorts of problems. This is why the L-sit/V-sit/manna progression is so important. It effectively counteracts the effects of a pushing heavy routine with one simple exercise series. This set of progressions works the scapular retractors

 - loc 44 - This is why the L-sit/V-sit/manna progression is so important. It effectively counteracts the effects of a pushing heavy routine with one simple exercise series. This set of progressions works the scapular retractors, posterior deltoids, and external rotators without doing 2-3 different exercises, saving much time and effort

 - loc 45 - The basics of this system can be summarized as: ÔÉ± Do one vertical push upwards, one vertical push downwards, and one horizontal pushing exercise ÔÉ± Do one vertical pulling exercise downwards, and one horizontal pulling exercise. ÔÉ± Do manna OR add in another horizontal pulling exercise OR inverted vertical pulling exercise

 - loc 46 - The one thing that is novel about the charts in this book is that many of the elements are based on the Federation International of Gymnastics (FIG) level of difficulty for skills. In the code of points (COP) there is a difficulty based A to F scale. A elements are the easiest, and F elements are the hardest

 - loc 47 - What I would suggest is to focus more on weaknesses and bringing the deficient skills and strength progressions up to the level of our more advanced abilities. Shoring up our weaknesses will help keep us healthier than if we solely pursued one set of strength or skill progressions. This is especially important if there is a vast difference in pulling versus pushing or a lack of development especially in regards to the Lsit/V-sit/manna progression

 - loc 48 - I would like to suggest that 6s static holds to count as competent to move up to the next skill level

 - loc 48 - I would say 3 repetitions of clean technique should be required to move up to the next progression

 - loc 48 - with eccentrics skills, if we can complete multiple repetitions over 3 seconds then we can consider ourselves competent in the movement

 - loc 50 - Handstands work the overhead flexion range of motion of the shoulders, and manna works the limit of hyperextension range of motion of the shoulders. By working them in tandem you are likely to progress more rapidly and safely

 - loc 50 - Coupling handstands and the L-sit/V-sit/manna progression

 - loc 50 - In a perfect world everyone would work both manna and handstands as coupled skills

 - loc 51 - Straight arm press handstands from support are actually a very good supplemental exercise for planche training because they require very solid amounts of shoulder girdle strength moving through a large range of motion

 - loc 52 - Handstand pushups, rope climbing (if available), and full back lever development are very important to the process of developing high level strength. The reasoning behind this is because they not only help with the development of neuromuscular strength, but also through building up of connective tissue and joint integrity. Thus, they are likely to help significantly in the development of higher upper level skills

 - loc 58 - Warmup is first. To adequately get the body into an optimal state for workouts a few key physiological changes must happen. Core temperature needs to be raised so that the chemical reactions in the muscles will take place faster, leading to better contractile function of the muscles and activation of the nervous system. Also, heart rate and blood flow should be elevated to provide oxygen and nutrients to the muscles and to export the waste

 - loc 58 - Skill and technique work should always be second. Once your nervous system and muscles are warmed up and primed to go this is the optimal time for the body to learn new skills or movement patterns

 - loc 59 - Power work, isometrics, eccentrics and other concentric strength work are third. They are here because they all require a very large stimulus from the central nervous system (CNS) to operate effectively. Since we are recruiting maximal or near maximal numbers of muscle fibers, it is important to perform these after low intensity activities ‚Äì warm up and skill work ‚Äì to get the full benefit out of them

 - loc 59 - 4. Endurance, metabolic conditioning, tabata method, interval training, circuits, etc. Endurance (everything else with it) is placed next in the routine. These exercises are mainly aimed at taking advantage of the energy systems of the muscles. Most of these exercises, unless done at extremely high intensity, are not as rough on the nervous system and musculature as the power, strength, eccentrics, etc. This means that you can still have a fairly good conditioning session after strength work whereas it would not work the same in reverse

 - loc 59 - Since muscle length is regulated by the nervous system via gamma afferent fibers in muscle spindles, it is much easier to get good stretching work done at the end when we have fatigued the nervous system and muscles from working out. Additionally, the muscles are much more pliable with the increased blood flow. Likewise, mobility work applies on the same principle

 - loc 59 - Finally, the static flexibility, prehabilitation work, and cool down are at the end

 - loc 60 - Handstands or handstand shoulder taps will help warm up the body and train skills at the same time

 - loc 60 - strength progressions that are 2-3 levels below your current competency level can be considered exercises that are appropriate for warm up or skill work

 - loc 61 - Static work held too long before strength training can slightly negatively affect the ability to exert maximal force, so it is important to limit trying to lengthen the muscles too much before training

 - loc 61 - Dynamic stretching and mobilization work is useful in the warm up to take the muscles through their entire range of motion

 - loc 62 - we want to put the eccentrics and isometrics in the beginning of the work leaving the dynamic movements for last

 - loc 62 - We also want to use full body movements before any specific isolation work that may be in line with our goals

 - loc 62 - Our body has two pools of resources from which to draw. Since the neuromuscular controls the musculoskeletal, we want to first execute tasks that use substantial amount of CNS involvement because they also use a lot of musculature. If we reverse the order we get highly degraded movements compared to the maximum potential that we could theoretically attain from the workout

 - loc 62 - we put the eccentrics and isometrics first because typical loads used are supramaximal (in the case of eccentrics) or near supramaximal loads (in the case of isometrics). Working up near the edge of our strength limit as we learned in the first chapter is tough on the CNS

 - loc 62 - most of the dynamic movements we will be working are well below our strength limit which makes them less taxing on the CNS

 - loc 63 - Chronic muscle tightness or deep soreness should be distinguished from the delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) that is common when new exercises are introduced

 - loc 64 - if our flexibility is hindering our development of some skills then we may need to add extra flexibility work into the beginning of the workout instead of just placing it at the end. One of the more effective things I have personally done for my manna progressions is to do my shoulder stretching (german hangs / skin the cats) directly before training manna so as to allow better movement of the shoulder girdle pressing into hyperextension

 - loc 64 - Generally, we are only going to add static flexibility work into the warmup or workouts if we have a range of motion limitation that is negatively affecting our ability to perform the exercise correctly. For example, this would be the case of the german hangs with the manna

 - loc 68 - A split routine such as say a biceps/back, triceps/chest, legs split hits all muscles once or maybe twice per week compared to a full body routine which allows thrice or more weekly work with particular muscle groups

 - loc 68 - With full body routines we perform more compound exercises and eliminate isolation exercises

 - loc 69 - isolation work is typically used effectively at the opposite ends of the fitness spectrum: injury and elite athletes

 - loc 71 - I tend to give the option of 1-2 goals. You can choose to be more focused or you can choose to be a bit more broad. 3 goals tends to be a bit too broad to work towards

 - loc 73 - our exercises should generally be prioritized in order of the importance of our goals

 - loc 79 - Neurologically we have the greatest capacity for strength gains, but it is also the neurological system that adapts relative to its potential the slowest when compared to muscle mass

 - loc 80 - Accumulation of fatigue which is equal to gains in fitness is called reaching a plateau in your training. Therefore, this point at which gains stall is good measure of when fatigue has overtaken fitness or supercompensatory adaptations that kept allowing us to constantly progress

 - loc 80 - The microcycle is typically based around 1 week of training. It is generally organized into a specific attribute that we want to focus on. In the old Soviet model there were generally 4 microcycles that were used: a preparatory phase, hypertrophy phase, strength phase, and a power phase

 - loc 80 - A mesocycle is a combination of 4-8 microcycles

 - loc 80 - date. They would still be training hard so they were strong, but it stopped early enough for a deload so they would get enough rest to dissipate extra fatigue. This would allow them to peak during the competition so that they could lift weights well above their previous personal records. This would hopefully allow them to win the competition. 67

 - loc 80 - A macrocycle is just a combination of mesocycles. Often the macrocycle was planned such that the athlete would finish their final mesocycle close to the competition date.

 - loc 81 - microcycles teach us the valuable lesson which is that we must consider overall volume weekly instead of workout to workout

 - loc 246 - Typical hunter gatherer carbohydrate sources ranged from about 22-40% of total energy intake. On a 2,000 calorie diet, this is 440 - 800 calories from carbohydrates which is 110-200g of carbohydrates a day

 - loc 246 - The biggest concepts that most trainees need to learn can be summed up in 4 axiomatic statements: 1. Diet modulates weight. 2. Exercise modulates body composition. 3. Nutrition quality will improve how fast you lose or gain weight. 4. Exercise intensity will improve how fast your body composition changes

 - loc 247 - 1. In regards to obesity, cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disease, diabetes, other metabolic derangement, digestive disorders, and autoimmune diseases to get the quickest/best results, it is recommended to go on a lower carbohydrate (typically <125g of carbohydrates from any source) or ketogenic diet (typically <30g carbohydrates) per day and get the rest of calories from protein, animal fats, or coconut/avocados/nuts. 2. In regards to athletes, the carbohydrate level can be increased through greater consumption of dietary carbohydrates in fruits and vegetables or good starches found in real foods such as sweet potatoes. 3. In regards to healthy living in otherwise disease free individuals, low or no carbohydrate diets are not recommended. Generally speaking, low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets are useful for correcting metabolic derangement and helping to reverse disease processes that are brought on by the ‚Äúbig four‚Äù factors that foster the diseases of civilization: (1) refined carbohydrates, in particular, fructose; (2) grains; (3) trans fats; and (4) omega 3:6 imbalances. All of these are prevalent in processed foods. Athletes, especially endurance athletes, need higher amounts of carbohydrates to function well at their particular sports or disciplines

 - loc 248 - If you are not allergic to milk I would suggest adding in whole milk to Paleo (even though milk is not Paleo) to get sufficient calories to encourage muscle gain

 - loc 249 - In the analogy, eliminating carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates, when you are less metabolically flexible is akin to eliminating the offending exercises or stimuli that are causing your chronic training injuries. Likewise, providing proper nutrition, such as Paleo where we focus on increasing food quality and nutrient availability, is similar to focusing on specific modalities and rehabilitation protocols aimed towards rehabbing our particular injuries

 - loc 250 - For eliminating colds and other upper respiratory tract infections such as the flu ‚Äì 10,000 - 30,000 IU of Vitamin D. Vitamin C DOES NOT HELP. 237

 - loc 250 - For eliminating colds and other upper respiratory tract infections such as the flu ‚Äì 10,000 - 30,000 IU of Vitamin D. Vitamin C DOES NOT HELP

 - loc 251 - The body uses inflammation to signal and start to repair the damage caused by working out. An inflammation cascade is initiated and maintained by the immune system until all tissues are repaired and strengthened against the stress that was placed on the body. In addition, stress from activity especially sustained activity elevates cortisol levels. Cortisol helps mobilize the body's supply of fat and glucose to provide fuel for the muscle, but it is an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive. For example, cortisone is a derivative of the same class of drugs, the glucocorticoids, and is used therapeutically to reduce pain and inflammation in specific areas of the body. Our immune system is the way that our body fights infections and other pathogens that make us sick. So you can see how diverting the immune system away from fighting infections towards repairing muscles may be problematic

 - loc 251 - my preference tends to be to advocate relaxation and rest during sickness. Let your body do its business and come back to hard workouts once you are healed

 - loc 252 - lying around doing nothing for the entire duration may not actually be as beneficial when sick than at least some type of movement aside from working out. Getting up and moving around to get blood flowing and doing some deep breathing to help mobilize secretions especially if you are coughing a lot is a good idea

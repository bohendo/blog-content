#  Power of Now
## by Eckhart Tolle
---

 - loc 296 - When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of “feeling-realization” is enlightenment.

 - loc 387 - Instead of “watching the thinker,” you can also create a gap in the mind stream simply by directing the focus of your attention into the Now.

 - loc 399 - One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child.

 - loc 411 - The term ego means different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created by unconscious identification with the mind.

 - loc 411 - The term ego means different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created by unconscious identification with the mind. To the ego, the present moment hardly exists. Only past and future are considered important.

 - loc 437 - would say that the simple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don’t know how to think but because they don’t know how to stop thinking!

 - loc 446 - Emotion arises at the place where mind and body meet. It is the body’s reaction to your mind — or you might say, a reflection of your mind in the body.

 - loc 464 - If there is an apparent conflict between them, the thought will be the lie, the emotion will be the truth. Not the ultimate truth of who you are, but the relative truth of your state of mind at that time.

 - loc 468 - To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and so is primarily felt in the body.

 - loc 483 - all emotions are modifications of one primordial, undifferentiated emotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are

 - loc 505 - Pleasure is always derived from something outside you, whereas joy arises from within. The very thing that gives you pleasure today will give you pain tomorrow, or it will leave you, so its absence will give you pain. And what is often referred to as love may be pleasurable and exciting for a while, but it is an addictive clinging, an extremely needy condition that can turn into its opposite at the flick of a switch.

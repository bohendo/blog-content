#  Be Slightly Evil
## by Venkatesh Rao

 - loc 103 - Every new “true” thing I learn seems to shrink the domain where I can hold useful moral opinions. There is no point having a moral opinion about the law of gravity. So truth is also about increasing moral minimalism.

 - loc 122 - Robert Coram’s fascinating book, Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War, which has now bumped Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to the #2 spot in my Be Slightly Evil reading list. You should also check out Chet Richards’ Certain to Win, an application of Boyd’s ideas to business.

 - loc 122 - Why can’t you just stay on the straight-and-narrow, pay your dues, and live an honorable life? I found a great answer in Robert Coram’s fascinating book, Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War, which has now bumped Robert Greene’s 48 Laws of Power to the #2 spot in my Be Slightly Evil reading list. You should also check out Chet Richards’ Certain to Win, an application of Boyd’s ideas to business.

 - loc 250 - Personally, I resolve this particular dichotomy by thinking of realism as a desire to see the world realistically, and pragmatism as a desire to be effective. Believing you have achieved either desire is probably a sign that you’re actually trapped within one of the quadrants. It is skepticism and doubt that mark sophisticated realism and pragmatism, and distinguish

 - loc 250 - Personally, I resolve this particular dichotomy by thinking of realism as a desire to see the world realistically, and pragmatism as a desire to be effective. Believing you have achieved either desire is probably a sign that you’re actually trapped within one of the quadrants. It is skepticism and doubt that mark sophisticated realism and pragmatism, and distinguish them from quadrant-locked attitudes and behaviors.

 - loc 301 - So if someone tells me that there is a free lunch somewhere, I make the default assumption that someone (or something), somewhere is paying/will pay costs corresponding to my gains. And until I am sure that someone isn’t me (or someone/something I care about), I am not ready to use that partial knowledge, even if it is true.

 - loc 346 - You can only stabilize at Slightly Evil if you make sure you always “pick on someone your own size” in a general sense. I don’t advocate fair fights entirely for moral reasons. I advocate them for the same reason physical trainers have you train with weights of increasing resistance. It is the only way you can grow. If you get too used to fighting below your weight class, your muscles will shrivel to match.

 - loc 363 - One good heuristic is to ask: after an encounter that you “win” in some sense, does the other person feel like they learned something valuable at a reasonable price or that they were played for a sucker, or paid too high a cost for the learning?  This only works if you haven’t already dehumanized the person in your own mind. One way to test for rationalization via dehumanization is to ask: would you want to win that way against a spouse, friend, child, pet or parent?

 - loc 391 - This result isn’t unique to Berkeley undergrads. Other studies have found similar results in the military, corporations and politics. “People give authority to people that they genuinely like,” says Mr. Keltner...

 - loc 395 - “It’s an incredibly consistent effect,” Mr. Keltner says. “When you give people power, they basically start acting like fools. They flirt inappropriately, tease in a hostile fashion, and become totally impulsive.” Mr. Keltner compares the feeling of power to brain damage, noting that people with lots of authority tend to behave like neurological patients with a damaged orbito-frontal lobe, a brain area that’s crucial for empathy and decision-making.

 - loc 418 - If a bunch of people are marooned on an island, who are they going to elect as leader? The jerky survivalist who is the only one who can keep them alive, and is likely to walk away and just take care of himself if crossed, or the nice guy?

 - loc 420 - “A CEO’s job is to interpret external realities for a company.”  I have met many people who’ve gained power and authority due to this particular trait, and it might conceivably be part of the explanation why power turns people into jerks. Reality is usually somewhere between neutral and slightly unpleasant, so most of the time, the “interpret external reality” job is a delicate balancing act on the leader’s part: you need to keep your people connected enough to reality to be effective, but not so connected that they are demotivated and demoralized

 - loc 465 - The tragic stance on the other hand, is based on the assumption that human beings are unchanging. That they have constant natures that are deeply limited and flawed, that cause them to fail in predictable ways

 - loc 469 - “Slightly Evil” of course, like all vaguely pop-Machiavellian philosophies, belongs in the tragic camp.

 - loc 473 - Now here is the paradox: idealism believes in change and creates unchanging human beings. Tragedism (to coin a word) believes humans cannot change their fundamental natures, yet believing in it actually transforms humans far more radically than the idealist view.

 - loc 486 - If you stubbornly stick to the idea that humans cannot change, then improving your life means changing your environment. As Shaw noted, “The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.”

 - loc 507 - The Idealist-Tragedian dichotomy has the same contours as the Nurture-Nature dichotomy. Both are false, both can be dissolved through reframing in terms of constrained design spaces, building blocks and path-dependent expression of the possibilities of that space.

 - loc 513 - The idealist goes off on a Zen retreat looking directly for change. The tragedian starts a business or writes a book and then resists and ultimately accepts the change as an inevitable consequence.

 - loc 513 - The idealist goes off on a Zen retreat looking directly for change. The tragedian starts a business or writes a book and then resists and ultimately accepts the change as an inevitable consequence. Good or bad, it is a rebirth. That is why you cannot call it “self-improvement.” Tragedian patterns of deeper creative-destructive change are fundamentally risky. A successful book or business may end up sending you into a spiral of drugs and depression, while utter failure may end up getting you to a moment of enlightenment far faster than the earnestly meditating Zen students.

 - loc 523 - “It’s a learning process” is a fine way to view mistakes until a mistake bankrupts, kills or psychologically destroys you.

 - loc 530 - Idealists often seek to be kind and end up being unwittingly cruel. Tragedians are often low-empathy sociopaths, but paradoxically end up doing good without meaning to.

 - loc 576 - Your personality can be understood as comprising two parts: a self and a shadow. The self represents the parts of yourself that you accept, and are attached to. You see those parts primarily as strengths. The shadow represents the parts of yourself that you reject as weaknesses, and have developed an aversion to. It is, for the most part, subconscious or unconscious.

 - loc 582 - Your self and shadow are not independent, but overlap. The intersection consists of those parts of yourself where you have engaged your shadow consciously. These are the parts that you understand neither as strengths, nor weaknesses, but simply elements of your true nature. So they actually represent your freedoms. The parts outside the intersection are addictions and aversions respectively, which enslave you to greater or lesser degrees.

 - loc 587 - your life journey can be described in a very succinct way: it is about integrating self and shadow, and getting the overlap zone to grow and cover your whole personality.

 - loc 614 - Chances are, in your personal processing approach, shadow behaviors that you recognize in others appear almost as the definition of evil to you. I do perceive people who behave in uncivil ways, or create disharmony through inconsiderate behavior, as being morally objectionable, not just a practical nuisance to deal with.  On the other hand, my evil twins are typically people who are very comfortable with overt conflict and morally object to something I am good at: managing perceptions and realities on separate tracks (which they view as the moral sin of lacking “authenticity”).

 - loc 621 - So to truly explore your shadow, yes, you need to tiptoe into behavioral territories that feel slightly evil to you

 - loc 642 - To truly realize the power of shadow boxing though, you have to translate the intense drama of your private life back into the banal situational script. Because that’s where the action actually unfolds. Ultimately, you have to manifest your abstract decisions (such as “curb extroverted feeling”) in concrete settings.

 - loc 732 - Felt status, played status and perceived status have almost nothing to do with each other at a fundamental level. Any relationships among these three variables are therefore quite arbitrary.

 - loc 736 - There are four status patterns: feeling low, playing low (LL), feeling low, playing high (LH), feeling high, playing low (HL), feeling high, playing high (HH).

 - loc 741 - You can easily detect the 4 patterns, but it takes deeper analysis to figure out whether you are seeing an absolute or relative use of the pattern.The

 - loc 764 - if status doesn’t matter to you, it becomes available to you as a situational control variable when dealing with those to whom status does matter. We all start out in a locked-status mode, but if you start breaking locked felt-played patterns then a curious thing happens: felt status of any sort weakens.

 - loc 771 - When two status-vacuum people meet, they typically recognize each other and abandon status-based manipulation altogether and spar with other weapons.

 - loc 790 - You need to constantly practice status playing skills, and even then the game gets tougher all the time as you meet more complicated people, in more demanding situations. You will play things wrong often, so you need to spread risk over multiple situations and people.

 - loc 798 - One warning. If you decide to go down this path, there is no turning back. Once your status firmware starts to shrivel, you can’t easily re-invigorate it. Being a status-player is also not an easy thing to hide in the long term, so you will be known for what you are, by people you interact with a lot. The best way to manage this perception is to openly acknowledge it and make sure your underlying values are understood and accepted by others.

 - loc 824 - What kind of behaviors should you deliberately publish? The ones others are afraid of triggering. In other words, the only buttons worth publishing are the ones others are afraid to push.

 - loc 874 - I almost never go through, and most effective people I’ve met also never go through. Going around is generally cheaper and less damaging.  But there is one situation where going through is useful, even if you would normally judge the situation to be a go-around situation. This is when you are new to a place. Plowing through an element of opposition demonstrates a willingness to fight when necessary, force of will and social intelligence in navigating status hierarchies. In other words, you have to make an example of some unfortunate opponent.

 - loc 918 - “I don’t know what the policy is on that, I’ll have to ask my manager.” The last one is particularly good at choking corporations. Since there is so much that is undefined, the default rule kicks in: if you don’t know, defer to your boss. If enough people resort to that rule often enough, the boss will get choked.

 - loc 926 - outside of collective action situations, sticking to the rules is one of the easiest ways to block, slow down or disrupt things others are trying to do, that you disagree with. If you can’t sustain an overt battle over something, don’t fight; merely execute strictly according to the rules.

 - loc 941 - one of the easiest ways to figure someone out is to look at the information they choose to consume.

 - loc 962 - This is not blatant stereotyping, it is blatant archetyping. A subtly different (and morally more defensible) approach to typecasting people. Sure you’ll go wrong sometimes, but you’ll be right more often.

 - loc 1005 - When someone has processed their thoughts, separated fact from feeling, separated what is already known from what is new or as yet unknown, and is offering up something they’ve deduced as being both true and unknown to you (and hence worth sharing), you’ll experience at least a momentary sense of expanded clarity. Candor and cursing on the other hand, will provoke emotional responses from you, rather than moments of mental clarity.

 - loc 1047 - Beyond-thick-skinned, contemptuous listening means you don’t take what is said about your personality as serious feedback worth responding to. But this does not mean you don’t listen. You listen in a sort of objective, clinical way, like a researcher observing an angry animal in a cage. Your radar is primed for information that is useful to you, not information that the other party thinks you ought to know

 - loc 1113 - The way to really protect yourself is to adopt George Costanza’s law: it’s not a lie if you believe in it.

 - loc 1141 - Condescension: I am better than you and for you  Contempt: I am better than you and against you  Supplication: I am worse than you and for you  Insolence: I am worse than you and against you It is very useful to learn to recognize these four attitudes. It makes you twice as effective as most people, who are usually only conscious of one or the other dimension (status or conflict/harmony).

 - loc 1160 - such status-and-conflict games are generally time-wasters (though you should learn to play them because you can be forced into them by external factors). Wherever possible, you should attempt to move the conversation to an open one that is about generating or exchanging information, or disengage if that turns out to be impossible

 - loc 1216 - The key to conflict without ego is the observation that you cannot get mad at facts. The sun rises everyday. Things fall to the ground. You need to pay employees.

 - loc 1231 - the key is to acknowledge and bracket emotions and consciously let them go. Some emotions are easier to handle this way than others, such as anger and pride. Others are harder: an emotion might have no name, and manifest very weakly as a slight tension in your lower back. The only way you can process is to become aware of it and let it go, even if you don’t understand where it came from or what it represents

 - loc 1244 - Violence is a necessary consequence of unavoidable ignorance on the part of systems that lack infinite wisdom. You cannot avoid it, or enlighten yourself out of it.  But for a long time I wasn’t able to translate this into a form more usable in everyday interactions. Only recently did I come up with an articulation that I sort of liked: The ideas of your friends are not always the friends of your ideas.  What does this mean? It means that even when two mindful and egoless individuals have adequately let go of emotions relating to buried, irrelevant, intrinsic motivations, and are dealing with the relevant facts and extrinsic motivations in sophisticated ways, and properly identifying and reacting appropriately to areas of ignorance, you will still have conflict.

 - loc 1262 - When a friendship can stand the test of sometimes-diverging, sometimes-converging pursuit of individual ideas, it acquires great depth. Relationships based on false harmony and denial of ideas, or worse, one party cravenly abandoning their own ideas in the interests of preserving the relationship, are fundamentally weak, and not worth very much.

 - loc 1275 - in routine negotiations, almost all the work is done away from the actual negotiating table, and before the critical face-to-face encounters. In many cases, the pre-work is so effective that the negotiation doesn’t happen at all, or if it happens, is a matter of ritual.

 - loc 1318 - About the only firm truth in negotiation is that people who are going to terminate all relationships and walk away very soon behave very differently from people who aren’t sure how much they’ll be dealing with each other in the future.

 - loc 1323 - The information, creativity and trust pre-work take time, and costs money. If the deal isn’t worth the pre-work, that’s one reason to walk away on Day 1.

 - loc 1356 - Slightly evil people often appear to be extreme risk takers to others. This is actually far from the truth. They are often more conservative. One of the big factors that creates the illusion of the slightly evil being daring gamblers is indifference to sunk costs.

 - loc 1358 - Here’s an example. Suppose you’ve put in eleven months of work into building a piece of software. You have one month left to finish when you suddenly discover a fantastic open-source equivalent that you can work on tweaking for two weeks, and produce a better outcome than if you persevered and finished your own design. At this point, the fact of you having put in eleven months worth of hard work is basically irrelevant. You’ll deliver a better outcome faster if you were to just throw away your own work and use the open-source equivalent. And that’s the path

 - loc 1369 - Where it gets irrational is if you tell yourself one story to make the decision, but another to live out the consequences. If you make the “rational” decision but suffer the regret for the rest of your life of not achieving closure, completion and the addition of another software war story to tell your grandchildren, you are being irrational.

 - loc 1389 - In the software example, let’s say two people were involved, you and a friend. If you are slightly evil, while your partner is heavily attached to closure and “finishing,” he may try very hard to make up rationalizations between your objective-weighted story and his subjective-weighted one (“we can’t use that open source thing; we haven’t tested it enough...”). If you make the sunk-costs-indifferent decision anyway, he may resent you and cause problems down the road.  To the slightly evil, the answer is simple. Do the future real costs of the resentment for you outweigh the benefit of making the sunk-costs-indifferent decision? If so, it is worth humoring your colleague. If not, make the sunk-costs indifferent decisions and deal with the fallout.

 - loc 1407 - So the slightly evil lesson is this: to the extent that the society you are in is tribal, being vindictive and indulging in vendettas is rational in objective terms. To the extent that the society around you is civilized, these behaviors will backfire. Revenge on the other hand is never objectively worthwhile, whether the society is tribal or civilized. This is rather ironic, since it is actually revenge that takes the most intelligence and rational planning.

 - loc 1421 - If you suspend judgement and immediately start looking around to actually figure out what happened, you are assuming nothing. This is the apparently rational, data-driven way to proceed. In contexts where winning matters (honking matches on the road aren’t among them), it is also a way to lose.  The problem with the apparently rational response is that such situations are often fast-moving and ambiguous, and it is hard to tell who was in the wrong. Often there is shared blame as well as a role played by bad luck. If you don’t act immediately, your rational analysis will not matter. Inaction is loss.

 - loc 1427 - Getting even is the key phrase here. Vindictiveness is a status-leveling move. If somebody hurts you, it doesn’t matter what the reasons and backstory are. If you don’t hurt them back, you’ve lost status points.  So the intensity of an vindictive reaction is usually proportionate to the perceived status loss, not to the actual material loss in the situation.

 - loc 1445 - This also explains why (again, in tribal societies) it is rational to push back harder than you were pushed. You prefer a decisive outcome to the shoving/pushing/shouting contest for three reasons, especially if there are witnesses. First, you should visibly exact a penalty for the opponent starting an unjustified conflict. Second, the opponent knows personally not to mess with you again, out of real fear of hurt. And third, if he does spread his own version of the story, even if he convinces his friends that he was morally right, you actually get PR for your not-to-be-messed-with reputation, because you won the actual fight.

 - loc 1452 - Even if you know you were wrong, if you ALSO know the other person cannot possibly know that, it pays to take offense and push back.  Why?  Because accepting blame without proof (i.e., needlessly admitting guilt) legitimizes the other person’s authority to act as judge, jury and executioner without proof.

 - loc 1469 - A vendetta is not a revenge. There isn’t a whole lot of deliberation, planning or subterfuge. In fact those tend to make for ineffective vendettas, because the point of every move and counter-move in a vendetta is to demonstrate raw power and making a “not guilty” case in the court of public opinion. The point is not to demonstrate intelligence. In fact, it pays to make your vendetta move as visibly close to the original as possible. If they killed one of your sons, you kill one (or two) of their sons. Complicating the story with clever moves makes it much harder to read socially,

 - loc 1471 - In fact, it pays to make your vendetta move as visibly close to the original as possible. If they killed one of your sons, you kill one (or two) of their sons. Complicating the story with clever moves makes it much harder to read socially, and third parties are left feeling uncertain about what is going on.

 - loc 1481 - Vendettas therefore, naturally escalate, because in the short-term, it makes more sense to overreact and let the other person deal with the market inefficiency, than to underreact.

 - loc 1511 - If your brother accidentally fall into the lion’s cage at the zoo and it eats him, you wanting to kill the lion is just plain silly. It was not playing status games with your brother. It was looking for lunch. Revenge against institutions is often equally silly. When they hurt you, it usually isn’t due to tribal status motives. Hence the wisdom in Hanlon’s Razor: never attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity.

 - loc 1524 - To the extent that an extended conflict is playing out in the same tribal context (such as a corporate department), where reputations matter, and to the extent that individual players are legible (i.e. you are not railing against a system to which you are imputing tribal motives), calibrated vindictive behavior is valuable.  To put it in the context of the most familiar battleground for most of us, if you do not push back when pushed in the office, you will have people walking all over you. A nominal organizational peer attempting to assert authority over you by “delegating” work to you over email requires immediate pushback to establish the right status relationship. Possibly with a cc to the joint manager. And yes, this does create a problem for the manager to deal with. That’s his/her job: to civilize the essentially tribal interaction for the greater good.

 - loc 1527 - if you do not push back when pushed in the office, you will have people walking all over you. A nominal organizational peer attempting to assert authority over you by “delegating” work to you over email requires immediate pushback to establish the right status relationship. Possibly with a cc to the joint manager. And yes, this does create a problem for the manager to deal with. That’s his/her job: to civilize the essentially tribal interaction for the greater good.

 - loc 1535 - But to the extent that our world is not tribal, you do need a place to direct your vindictive instincts. There are only two real options: learn to forget, forgive and move on (probably to a different tribe), or go insane.

 - loc 1555 - we normally don’t settle disputes with fists or yelling anymore. We pretend that everybody is reasonable, and therefore resort to reason, at least on the surface.  Now reasoning is a mechanical process only for simplistic computer programs. For humans, it is a matter of pulling out favored patterns of argumentation from a playbook in memory.

 - loc 1570 - Bob used the “open and transparent” argument (inferring the consequences of assumed shared values in disingenuous ways to score a cheap point and occupy the moral high ground). Alice filed away the pattern and reversed it when it suited her. The tactic works not because the reasoning pattern is strong but because it is weak.

 - loc 1570 - Bob used the “open and transparent” argument (inferring the consequences of assumed shared values in disingenuous ways to score a cheap point and occupy the moral high ground). Alice filed away the pattern and reversed it when it suited her. The tactic works not because the reasoning pattern is strong but because it is weak. You could challenge such a pattern the moment you spot it, and enter into a long argument. Or you could just file it away to use as a petard later.

 - loc 1573 - Many sitcom plots are entirely driven by status see-saws caused by hoist-by-own-petard dynamics.  The nice thing is that even though the argument is weak, your opponent will not want to attack it, since doing so would undermine their own previous use of the tactic.

 - loc 1580 - reason is a very dangerous, double-edged tool to use when playing status games. Use other tools.

 - loc 1596 - “The standard Foreign Office response to any crisis is:  Stage One: We say nothing is going to happen  Stage Two: We say that something may be going to happen, but we should do nothing about it  Stage Three: We say that maybe we should do something about it, but there’s nothing we can do  Stage Four: We say that maybe there was something we could have done but it’s too late now.”

 - loc 1633 - Deception is very nearly an amoral behavior. There are “good” lies: little white lies, nurturing lies, and complicity in the larger polite fictions of society. And there are “bad” lies that help you inflict as much destruction as possible.

 - loc 1637 - I find it very useful to think in terms of a hierarchy of deception skills, from the least sophisticated to the most sophisticated. The less sophisticated ones are harder to justify than the more sophisticated ones, which is reason enough to increase your sophistication level.  The least sophisticated form of deception is outright lying and fabrication of evidence.  A slightly more sophisticated form of deception is misdirection. You don’t lie, but you foreground a pattern of true information that is likely to lead to false conclusions.  Next you get withholding of information. You don’t lie or misdirect, but you don’t necessarily share any information that you don’t have to.  Next, you get equivocation, or sharing of information in ambiguous ways. This allows you to maintain plausible deniability against charges of lying, misdirection or withholding information, and relies on the predisposition of the other party to draw certain conclusions over others.  At the final level of sophistication, you get not-correcting-others. You don’t lie, misdirect, withhold or equivocate. But when others are drawing false conclusions that you could correct if you chose to (or missing inferences that are obvious to you due to your greater skill), you selectively choose not to help them out.

 - loc 1661 - I assert that you should give away the advantage in direct proportion to the amount of doubt you feel. Not only does this seem fair in some cosmic sense, but it is also a great way to prevent moral doubt from paralyzing you to the point that you don’t act at all.

 - loc 1673 - “You must be willing to look foolish.”  Why is this bad advice? It is bad advice because it turns the manageable problem of damage control into some kind of holy cross that you must necessarily, and passively, bear.

 - loc 1683 - You should certainly accept that failure is imminent the moment the signs are clear. When the writing’s on the wall, it is time to quit fighting for success. But that doesn’t mean it is time to switch into noble passivity, waiting for the blow to fall.

 - loc 1690 - As a principal in a risky endeavor, unless you are prone to denial, you’ll realize that failure is unavoidable long before others do. This means you have the most time and control over consequences, which includes a degree of control over how, where and when others find out what’s happening, and how they react.

 - loc 1695 - Looking foolish is serious business. Reputations take a long time to establish and minutes to lose. Of all potential consequences, “looking foolish” is the most damaging.

 - loc 1723 - people who are in an annoyed state behave more predictably than those who are in a non-annoyed state, where they are actually thinking. If you ever need to stop somebody from thinking too much about something, and more benign methods like flattery, distraction or avoidance fail, you escalate by being annoying.

 - loc 1726 - you cannot really annoy people by attacking their weaknesses. You can only insult them and buy anger and resentment that might come back to bite you in the form of vindictiveness. When you annoy people using their strengths on the other hand, they tend to get frustrated with themselves, rather than angry at you.

 - loc 1735 - all annoyance tactics are derived from the natural behaviors of stupid, illogical, uncreative and unintuitive people, and rely on the mechanics of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

 - loc 1744 - In information wars, filters are power and useless data are weapons.

 - loc 1747 - To control how a decision is framed and made, you have to control the data flows that feed into that decision. This requires two levels of work. First, you have to frame the decision. This step determines which data are deemed important and relevant. Second, you have to hide some data and exaggerate the importance of other data. Framing is a more powerful lever, since by perversely misframing a decision, you can send someone down a completely irrelevant bunny trail and give them the illusion of choice.

 - loc 1762 - In data flows, there is no real protection against manipulation by people with more privileged and direct access to data,

 - loc 1784 - Intuition in data-driven thinking doesn’t vanish, it merely moves from the answers to the questions

 - loc 1784 - Intuition in data-driven thinking doesn’t vanish, it merely moves from the answers to the questions. There are extremely sophisticated thinkers who simply “get” data-driven decision-making without knowing any statistics or technical details: they understand that being intelligently data-driven is simply about asking the right questions at the right time, which is something that takes hard thinking and a sense of timing rather than technical skills.It

 - loc 1823 - More generally, sending people off on useless learning missions and digital wild-goose chases is one of the best ways to distract them from substantive issues.

 - loc 1824 - A real thinker will not move on to technical questions about sampling (“is this i.i.d?”) before thinking through the qualitative and narrative questions (“are women really the target market here?”). If you want to distract a CDDD from the important questions about a sample, scare them with methodological questions: “Are we really sure this time series is i.i.d?

 - loc 1829 - being forced to use these techniques wastes useful talent. If at all possible, try and point a CDDD in a direction where they can do good. Unfortunately, this is often impossible, because of their false sense of confidence. Because they are often more competent around data tools than their peers, they mistakenly believe they are also more insightful around data in general.

 - loc 1829 - If at all possible, try and point a CDDD in a direction where they can do good. Unfortunately, this is often impossible, because of their false sense of confidence. Because they are often more competent around data tools than their peers, they mistakenly believe they are also more insightful around data in general.

 - loc 1864 - Reacting with a repetition (or a slightly modified repetition) is a cognitively lightweight operation, so it is quick enough to prevent an emotional hijacking. Depending on the situation, it can take some nerves to do the repetition drained of emotional content, but it is still a straightforward behavior to practice and learn.  What happens next? Usually, the bull will see your response as a request for elaboration. Elaboration takes coherent thinking, so he/she will be forced to slow down before saying anything more.

 - loc 2001 - To set up a model for Kai’s problem, imagine a 2x2 with scripted and unscripted on the X-axis, and failure and success on the Y-axis. In the paycheck world, you have scripts for both success and failure that tell you how to behave and react.

 - loc 2010 - But in the unscripted part of the world of work that free agents inhabit, there are far fewer behaviors to imitate, no well-tested scripts, and few social cues helping you calibrate success/failure and suggesting appropriate behaviors. If you’re actually failing (failing to make rent for example), the problem is quite simple. At some point you’ll run out of money no matter how low your burn rate, and end up having to head back to the scripted world or spiral down into a homeless shelter.  The problem is with success. You have enough to continue indefinitely, with a little discretionary surplus that allows you to think beyond the next rent check. And that’s where the trouble starts.  You’re not quite sure how to calibrate your response to your evolving situation.

 - loc 2023 - Even radical success doesn’t make this lack of narrative structure go away. When things are absolutely booming, you have to face the terror of the thought that it may be a transient success that could vanish as quickly as it appeared. The question then becomes, this is too good to last; am I making enough hay while the sun is shining? Or, where can I safely put this cash I am spinning right now?  So what do you do? The key to the answer is one word: insurance. Insurance is the idea that drives script building and behaviors for those who lack a script to deal with the rewards of success.

 - loc 2093 - But just because there is always more you can do – and you should, it is the definition of being alive in a way – does not mean you cannot take a nap.  So take that nap. Mortality will always be staring you in the face when you wake up, and you can always fret about the next bit of insurance you can buy with your next dollar when you wake up in 45 minutes.

 - loc 2118 - The problem here with K is that she forgot the first rule of dueling: as the challenged party, you need to exercise your prerogative to choose the time, place and manner of combat. That is the great advantage in being the reactor rather than the instigator. Don’t choose a drunken fist-fight in a bar simply because that’s where the challenge was thrown down. If pistols at dawn work better for you, choose those.

 - loc 2157 - Isolated tactical problems are very rare, and if you are seeing any situation as “how do I respond to this email” or “what do I say in this meeting,” chances are, you are misframing a broader problem and heading towards your personal Vietnam.

 - loc 2171 - Here’s the effective method: you need to interrupt as soon as you’ve roughly understood that there is an objectionable point being made (which can be before the speaker has finished making it), and before you’ve decided what to say. You do so by thinking out aloud, going “Aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!” or “Ehhhhummmmmm!” clearly, and stretching out your interrupt phrase over several seconds, until the interruptee shuts up and looks towards you. And most importantly, it should be patently clear that you haven’t yet decided what to say, and are thinking about it.

 - loc 2181 - Important people feel confident enough about their situational status to effectively say, “I disagree, but I am important enough that you should all shut up and wait while I figure out why, even if it means wasting 10 seconds of everybody’s time.”

 - loc 2208 - Bauer immediately requests permission to ask the girl a few questions. The doctor passes the question to the girl’s father. The father, for reasons we learn later, does not want the girl questioned. His response is the perfect dodge: “Let me go in and check if she is up to it first.”

 - loc 2215 - You can’t really argue with such a reasonable-sounding dodge that doesn’t comprehensively say “no,” but moves the “maybe yes” to a place from where it can slide effectively into a “no.”

 - loc 2229 - By injecting enough subjective and emotion-laden information into a decision indirectly, you can make it impossible for others to question your right to make the call unilaterally. Every emotional-charging decision dodge is a case of seeking refuge in the fortress of “don’t tell me how to feel.”

 - loc 2254 - Being inside an adversary’s tempo is all about wrangling luck to exploit habits.

 - loc 2261 - To get inside the tempo of an adversary is to recognize and exploit the ways in which he or she (or it, in the case of organizations) is a creature of habit. And we all are creatures of habit to some extent because we possess limited attention.

 - loc 2278 - There are two distinct setup moves, people moves and process moves. A fundamental tenet of luck wrangling is that you do people before process. This means creating a configuration of alliances and oppositions to create a pattern of conflict

 - loc 2297 - Broken promises are inevitable under conditions of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA). It is important to avoid demanding, or promising, absolute loyalty.

 - loc 2316 - To summarize:  Adult-adult or no deal: don’t ask for, or offer, absolute loyalties  Contingent but sincere: don’t play loyalty games  Don’t be your own #1: it is easier to Be Slightly Evil on behalf of others Once you’ve created a pattern of conflict that respects the three laws, it’s time to frame rules of engagement: unilateral agreements with yourself that limit how you act. This is the process setup stage.

 - loc 2351 - Wrangling luck by influencing how serendipity and zemblanity slosh around is the same as wrangling VUCA.  While a lot of VUCA emerges in the physical environment, in competitive settings, much of it originates in people, in the social layer of gameplay itself. So in the context of interpersonal interactions, VUCA means the following:  Volatility: there are no pure friends or enemies; most players you interact with are likely to be allies today, adversaries tomorrow and neutrals the day after.  Uncertainty: it is hard to tell potential allies and adversaries apart at a fundamental level, because situations and optimal patterns of loyalty are fundamentally murky..  Complexity: Ever tried to diagram the set of who-hates-whom/who-likes-whom in the organization chart of a corporation? Intractable beyond about a dozen.  Ambiguity: The environment is what it is. Ambiguity is a feature of your mental model of it, characterized by ifs, buts and maybes in your thinking about a situation.

 - loc 2363 - Risk is a function of VUCA. The higher the VUCA, the higher the perceived risk of any path.

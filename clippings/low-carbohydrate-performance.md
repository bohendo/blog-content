#  Low Carbohydrate Performance

 - loc 250 - you will find that the peak rate of fat burning (grams of fat oxidized per minute or per hour) occurs on average at about 50% of maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) if you’re untrained and at 65% VO2max if you’re trained[

 - loc 255 - In fact, as you push up close to maximal oxygen capacity, there is a rather sharp decline in fat oxidation – not just its proportion, but in absolute grams per minute as well.

 - loc 445 - Thus there is a reciprocal relationship between blood ketones and uptake in muscle; such that when blood ketone levels are low, muscle uptake is high, whereas at higher levels, muscle uptake is reduced.

 - loc 449 - Since monocarboxylic acid transporters function to take up both ketones and lactate, and they are upregulated in the presence of high ketones, might keto-adaptation result in better handling of lactate (not just through less production but better clearance as well)?

 - loc 487 - In keto-adapted athletes, however, there appears to be less need for muscle to use BCAA as fuel, perhaps because the BCAA and ketones have similar ‘carbon skeletons’ and thus the ketones are burned in place of the BCAA.

 - loc 584 - There are 4 well-controlled, inpatient, metabolic ward studies (the gold standard for human research) published from 1982 thru 1997 that showed statistically significant reductions in resting metabolic rate when overweight subjects performed 300-600 Calories per day of endurance exercise for weeks at a time[28-31]. There are no equally rigorous human studies showing the opposite.

 - loc 700 - Although variable from person to person, to get your blood ketones above 1 millimolar typically requires that you consume less than 50 grams of carbohydrate per day.

 - loc 783 - Do not purposely seek out lean cuts and do not worry about trimming visible fat as this will likely contribute to over-consumption of protein relative to fat. You actually need the fat to fuel your body, and the type found in meats is very suitable, plus it contributes to flavor and satiety.

 - loc 812 - Berries (e.g., rasp-, straw-, blue-, etc), tomatoes, olives and avocados are relatively low in carbohydrate and packed with nutrients. A daily total of up to 100 grams (3.5 oz) of these berry fruits can be consumed. These are fruits that contain less than 10% by weight total carbs, so 3.5 oz (about half a cup, or 100 grams) provides less than 10 grams.

 - loc 840 - Consuming even small amounts of carbohydrate after exercise rapidly decreases the release of fatty acids from fat stores and oxidation of fat in the muscle[40], thereby interfering with keto-adaption, plus also diminishing the beneficial effects of exercise on insulin sensitivity and other cardio-metabolic risk markers[

 - loc 868 - Too little or too much protein can be problematic in the keto-adapted state. Aim for a protein intake between 0.6 to 1.0 grams per pound of lean body mass.

 - loc 869 - Aim for a protein intake between 0.6 to 1.0 grams per pound of lean body mass.

 - loc 904 - There may be some benefit to including a good source of essential amino acids after resistance exercise, and especially if increased muscle mass is your goal. This does not have to be a protein supplement – your post-exercise amino acids can come from ‘typical’ foods. Consider a fruit smoothie made with naturally fermented yogurt, a cup of home-made meat broth, or creamed soups made from this broth. It is also a good idea to replace water and sodium loss after a workout.

 - loc 914 - To maintain nutritional ketosis, as a proportion of total calories, your fat intake will need to be high (~65 to 80%).

 - loc 923 - Therefore a key to successful keto-adaptation is figuring out ways to specifically increase your fat intake without over-consuming carbohydrate and protein.

 - loc 950 - Thus, in seeking out foods to eat, keep in mind the necessity to emphasize MUFA and SFA while keeping carbs low and consuming both protein and PUFA in moderation. Factoid: A 50:50 mixture of butter and olive oil approximates the composition of triglycerides typically found in human body fat.

 - loc 958 - It is a common mistake for people to assume that your intake of saturates is what determines your blood level of this much maligned nutrient, but this is incorrect. Particularly in the keto-adapted state, fat is being burned at a much higher rate, and this is particularly true for saturated fat. In two recently published studies we showed that a low carbohydrate, high fat diet significantly decreased circulating levels of saturated fat[23, 59]. It’s hard to imagine how dietary saturated fat can be problematic when it is promptly burned to carbon dioxide and water.

 - loc 968 - The clinical importance of consuming a lower omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is well established[60], but there are additional reasons why athletes may benefit. Omega-6 fats are more strongly associated with inflammation than omega-3 fats. Increasing omega-3 status consistently leads to lower levels of inflammation, and it also has a potent effect on lowering fat levels (triglycerides) in the blood.

 - loc 994 - the human system doesn’t seem to tolerate a high fat diet prepared from high omega-6 oils (like soy and corn oils), but does just fine on one consisting mostly of monounsaturated and saturated fats (e.g., olive oil and animal fats). This doesn’t mean you can’t eat mayo, just find one made from olive or canola oil or make your own. And please, don’t be fooled by the ag-industry advertising that touts high PUFA oils as being heart healthy. While this message might have some validity for someone eating a very low fat diet, at the high fat end of the dietary fat spectrum, it is completely invalid (if not dangerous).

 - loc 1007 - The best oils to use are those that are low in PUFA, such as olive, canola, ‘high oleic’ safflower, coconut and palm. Steer clear of corn, soybean, cottonseed, peanut, and safflower, as well as margarines and mayonnaise made with any of these oils. Butter and fat from beef (tallow) or pork (lard) are also excellent choices, both as they occur in natural foods and as fats added in cooking.

 - loc 1012 - Animal fats such as those in meats, eggs, and dairy are relatively low in PUFA and good sources of SFA and MUFA. Other good sources of fat are olives, avocados, heavy cream, sour cream, nuts, seeds, and cheese.

 - loc 1021 - Fish from cold water are the richest source of the main omega-3 fats (EPA [20:5] and DHA [22:6)] that we need to maintain healthy membranes. Good sources of these fatty acids are salmon, tuna, sardines, and herring

 - loc 1036 - Low carbohydrate diets increase the loss of sodium and water by the kidneys.

 - loc 1111 - The darker green the vegetable, the more magnesium it contains. But if you boil it until it’s mushy, when you throw away the water, you throw away much of the magnesium.

 - loc 1111 - The darker green the vegetable, the more magnesium it contains. But if you boil it until it’s mushy, when you throw away the water, you throw away much of the magnesium. So here’s the key to getting enough magnesium from your diet. When you cook meat, capture the drippings and add it back as sauce. If you boil meat or bones, drink the broth or reduce it to make sauce. Steam vegetables rather than boiling them, and cook them until they are ‘al dente’ (to the tooth) rather than soft enough to eat without teeth. Do all of these things routinely and you’ll probably get enough magnesium from your diet without supplements.

Do all of these things routinely and you’ll probably get enough magnesium from your diet without supplements.

 - loc 1245 - Natural sources of MCT are dairy fats (e.g., butter and cream) and coconut oil, so you may find your ketones go up more after ingestion of these foods.

#  Accounting Made Simple

 - loc 100 - accounting is the system of tracking the income, expenses, assets, and debts of a business.

 - loc 115 - concept of accounting: the accounting equation. The accounting equation states that at all times, and without exceptions, the following will be true: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity

 - loc 115 - The accounting equation states that at all times, and without exceptions, the following will be true: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity So what does that mean? Let’s take a look at the equation piece by piece. Assets: All of the property owned by the company. Liabilities: All of the debts that the company currently has outstanding to lenders. Owners’ Equity (a.k.a. Shareholders’ Equity): The company’s ownership interest in its assets, after all debts have been repaid.

 - loc 129 - …it might be easier to think of it this way: Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ Equity

 - loc 136 - a liability for one person is, in fact, an asset for somebody else. For example, if you take out a loan with your bank, the loan is clearly a liability for you. From the perspective of your bank, however, the loan is an asset.

 - loc 141 - A company’s assets consist of all the property that the company owns.  A company’s liabilities consist of all the debt that the company owes to lenders.  A company’s owners’ equity is equal to the owners’ interest in the company’s assets, after paying back all the company’s debts.  The accounting equation is always written as follows: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity  However, it’s likely easier to think of the accounting equation this way: Assets – Liabilities = Owners’ Equity.

 - loc 215 - A company’s balance sheet shows its financial position at a given point in time. Balance sheets are formatted in accordance with the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Owners’ Equity Current assets are those that are expected to be converted into cash within 12 months or less. Any asset that is not a current asset is a non-current (a.k.a. long-term) asset by default. Current liabilities are those that will need to be paid off within the next 12 months. By default, any liability that is not a current liability is a long-term liability.

 - loc 265 - The income statement shows a company’s financial performance over a period of time (usually a year). A company’s gross profit is equal to its revenues minus its Cost of Goods Sold. A company’s operating income is equal to its gross profit minus its operating expenses—the expenses that have to do with the core operation of the business. A company’s net income is equal to all of its revenues and gains, minus all of its expenses and losses.

 - loc 325 - The statement of retained earnings details the changes in a company’s retained earnings over a period of time. The statement of retained earnings acts as a bridge between the income statement and the balance sheet. It takes information from the income statement, and it provides information to the balance sheet. Dividend payments are not an expense. They are a distribution of profits. Retained earnings is not the same as cash. Often, a significant portion of a company’s retained earnings is spent on attempts to grow the company.

 - loc 981 - In accounting, negative numbers are indicated using parentheses.

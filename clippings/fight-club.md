 - loc 210 - La petite mort,

 - loc 580 - After a night in fight club, everything in the real world gets the volume turned down. Nothing can piss you off. Your word is law, and if other people break that law or question you, even that doesn’t piss you off.

 - loc 588 - Maybe self-improvement isn’t the answer. Tyler never knew his father. Maybe self-destruction is the answer.

 - loc 854 - "If you lose your nerve before you hit the bottom,” Tyler says, "you’ll never really succeed.” Only after disaster can we be resurrected. "It’s only after you’ve lost everything,” Tyler says, "that you’re free to do anything.”

 - loc 907 - Tyler says to pay attention because this is the greatest moment of my life. "Because everything up to now is a story,” Tyler says, "and everything after now is a story.” This is the greatest moment of our life.

 - loc 1720 - Even a week after fight club, you’ve got no problem driving inside the speed limit.

 - loc 1721 - Other cars drive around you. Cars tailgate. You get the finger from other drivers. Total strangers hate you. It’s absolutely nothing personal. After fight club, you’re so relaxed, you just cannot care. You don’t even turn the radio on.

 - loc 1759 - "If the prodigal son had never left home,” the mechanic says, "the fatted calf would still be alive.”

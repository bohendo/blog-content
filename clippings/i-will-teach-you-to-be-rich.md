#  I Will Teach You To Be Rich
## by Ramit Sethi

 - loc 104 - Focusing on these details is the easiest way to get nothing done.

 - loc 106 - People love to argue minor points, partially because they feel it absolves them from actually having to do anything.

 - loc 168 - Do you need to be the Iron Chef to cook a grilled-cheese sandwich? No, and once you make your first meal, itâ€™ll be easier to cook the next most complicated thing. The single most important factor to getting rich is getting started, not being the smartest person in the room.

 - loc 908 - Online banks have no branches and no tellers and spend very little on marketing, which allows them to accept lower profit margins than conventional banks. That savings is passed on to you as lower fees and higher interest rates. I also love the fact that online banks cut off problem customers.

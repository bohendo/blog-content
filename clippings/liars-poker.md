 - loc 155 - When Gutfreund had been crowned by the gentlemen of the press, you could almost hear traders thinking: Foolish names and foolish faces often appear in public places.

 - loc 356 - Glass-Steagall was an act of the U.S. Congress, but it worked more like an act of God. It cleaved mankind in two. With it, in 1934, American lawmakers had stripped investment banking off from commercial banking.

 - loc 476 - “There is a magic moment, during which a man has surrendered a treasure, and during which the man who is about to receive it has not yet done so. An alert lawyer [read bond trader] will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on.”

 - loc 481 - Once the trader knows the location of the IBM bonds and the temperament of their owner, he doesn’t have to be outstandingly clever to make the bonds (the treasure) move again. He can generate his own magic microseconds.

 - loc 490 - Knowing about markets is knowing about other people’s weaknesses. And a fool, they would say, was a person who was willing to sell a bond for less or buy a bond for more than it was worth. A bond was worth only as much as the person who valued it properly was willing to pay. And Salomon, to complete the circle, was the firm that valued the bonds properly.

 - loc 497 - At a rare Saturday press conference, on October 6, 1979, Volcker announced that the money supply would cease to fluctuate with the business cycle; money supply would be fixed, and interest rates would float. The event, I think, marks the beginning of the golden age of the bond man.

 - loc 969 - Best of all, he gave us a rule of thumb about information in the markets that I later found useful: “Those who say don’t know, and those who know don’t say.”

 - loc 1067 - Think of the History! Think of the Culture! I thought instead of a good rule for survival on Wall Street: Never agree to anything proposed on someone else’s boat, or you’ll regret it in the morning.

 - loc 1212 - The surprise was not that Salomon called him, but that O’Grady had agreed to listen. The only thing history teaches us, a wise man once said, is that history doesn’t teach us anything. O’Grady took a job with Salomon Brothers.

 - loc 1452 - Thrifts in the Sun Belt had small deposits and a lot of demand for money from home buyers. Thrifts in the Rust Belt held massive deposits for which they had no demand. Dall saw a solution. Rust Belt thrifts could effectively lend to Sun Belt homeowners by buying the mortgage bonds of Sun Belt thrifts.

 - loc 1703 - From the moment the Federal Reserve lifted interest rates in October 1979, thrifts hemorrhaged money. The entire structure of home lending was on the verge of collapse. There was a time when it seemed that if nothing were done, all thrifts would go bankrupt. So on September 30, 1981, Congress passed a nifty tax break* for its beloved thrift industry. It provided massive relief for thrifts. To take advantage of it, however, the thrifts had to sell their mortgage loans. They did.

 - loc 1709 - The only fully staffed mortgage department on Wall Street was no longer awkward and expensive; it was a thriving monopoly.

 - loc 1768 - However, as I have said, the notion of trusting the thrifts gave Salomon’s top brass the willies.

 - loc 1773 - Ranieri & Co. intended to transform the “whole loans” into bonds as soon as possible by taking them for stamping to the U.S. government. Then they could sell the bonds to Salomon’s institutional investors as, in effect, U.S. government bonds. For that purpose, partly as the result of Ranieri’s persistent lobbying, two new facilities had sprung up in the federal government alongside Ginnie Mae. They guaranteed the mortgages that did not qualify for the Ginnie Mae stamp. The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (called Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (called Fannie Mae) between them, by giving their guarantees, were able to transform most home mortgages into government-backed bonds.

Once they were stamped, however, nobody cared about the quality of the loans. Defaulting homeowners became the government’s problem. The

 - loc 1899 - Being a mortgage trader at Salomon more often meant being a mortgage buyer than a mortgage seller. “Steve Baum [the whole loan trader] was running a two-billion-dollar thrift,” says one of his former colleagues. Like a thrift, Baum found himself sitting on loans for long periods. (Unlike a thrift, he prospered.) This completed the curious reversal in roles that occurred in the early 1980s, when thrifts became traders and traders thrifts. (What was happening is that Wall Street was making the entire savings and loan industry redundant. One day someone brave will ask: “Why don’t we just do away with S and Ls entirely?”)

 - loc 1947 - The trick was to determine beforehand which of the government project loans was likely to prepay, for when it did, there was an enormous windfall to the owner of the loan, the lender. This arose because project loans traded below a hundred cents on the dollar. When Roth and Brittenham bought loans at sixty cents on the dollar that prepaid immediately, they realized a fast forty cents on the dollar profit.

 - loc 1951 - Where there was distress, there was always opportunity. “It was great if you could find a government housing project that was about to default on its mortgage,” says Brittenham. It was great because the government guaranteed the loan and, in the event of a default, paid off the loan in full.

 - loc 1954 - The other kind of project likely to prepay its mortgage was the cushy upmarket property. Brittenham recalls, “You’d look for a nice property—not a slum—something with a nice pool, tennis court, microwave ovens. When you found it, you’d say to yourself, ‘That’s a likely conversion.’” To convert, the occupants bought out the owner-developer, who would, in turn, repay the loan to the government

 - loc 1959 - The wonder is that the people in Washington who sold the loans did not do the same. But they didn’t understand the value of the loans. Instead they trusted the market to pay them the right price. The market, however, was inefficient.

 - loc 2265 - The beautiful inefficiency of mortgage bonds was spoiled for Salomon by one of its own creations, called the collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO).

 - loc 2273 - To create a CMO, one gathered hundreds of millions of dollars of ordinary mortgage bonds—Ginnie Maes, Fannie Maes, and Freddie Macs. These bonds were placed in a trust. The trust paid a rate of interest to its owners. The owners had certificates to prove their ownership. These certificates were CMOs. The certificates, however, were not all the same. Take a typical three-hundred-million-dollar CMO. It would be divided into three tranches, or slices of a hundred million dollars each. Investors in each tranche received interest payments. But the owners of the first tranche received all principal repayments from all three hundred million dollars of mortgage bonds held in trust. Not until first tranche holders were entirely paid off did second tranche investors receive any prepayments. Not until both first and second tranche investors had been entirely paid off did the holder of a third tranche certificate receive prepayments. The effect was to reduce the life of the first tranche and lengthen the life of the third tranche in relation to the old-style mortgage bonds. One could say with some degree of certainty that the maturity of the first tranche would be no more than five years, that the maturity of the second tranche would fall somewhere between seven and fifteen years, and that the maturity of the third tranche would be between fifteen and thirty years. Now, at last, investors had a degree of certainty about the length of their loans.

 - loc 2675 - all employees received two gifts: a large silver-plated bowl, with the name of the company inscribed on its side, and a book. The bowl was good for putting Doritos in. The book, called Salomon Brothers: Advance

 - loc 2703 - rely, to an extent, on others. Plenty of people at Salomon

 - loc 2705 - He was fond of saying that as a geek I bore the stamp of whomever I had last spoken with. I was, he felt, uncommonly soft-brained upon my arrival. If I had last spoken to the mortgage bond trader, I would be on the phones to people to say what a good deal mortgage bonds were.

 - loc 3099 - There was nothing spectacular about my sales pitch except the language in which it was couched. I used the language of the speculator. Most bond salesmen use the language of investment, analyzing the company and its prospects. I was vaguely aware that Olympia & York was involved in property. I was keenly aware that the whole world was lined up against its bonds. They were so out of fashion, I argued, they must be cheap. It was language my Frenchman understood.

 - loc 3590 - In her book The Predators’ Ball, Connie Bruck traced the rise of Drexel’s junk bond department (Milken reportedly tried to pay the author not to publish).

 - loc 3591 - rise of Drexel’s junk bond department (Milken reportedly tried to pay the author not to publish).

 - loc 3595 - The owner of a portfolio of fallen angels, by Milken’s analysis, almost always outperformed the owner of a portfolio of blue-chip bonds. There was a reason: Investors shunned fallen angels out of a fear of seeming imprudent. It is a remarkably simple observation. Like Alexander, Milken noticed that investors were constrained by appearances and, as a result, had left a window of opportunity open for a trader who was not.

 - loc 3601 - The parallels between Milken and Ranieri are striking. Like Ranieri, Milken lacked both tact and couth, but not confidence. He was perfectly happy to stand apart from his colleagues. Milken sat in a corner of the trading floor while he created his market, ostracized until he made too much money to be anything but the boss.

 - loc 3620 - My view is that he combined two qualities that were, at the time of his ascendancy, regarded as mutually exclusive. They certainly did not coexist within Salomon Brothers in the early 1980s. Milken possessed both raw bond-trading skills and patience with ideas. He had an attention span.

 - loc 3664 - bonds when all seemed lost but wasn’t. What Milken was saying was that the entire American credit-rating system was flawed. It focused on the past when it should have focused on the future, and it was burdened by a phony sense of prudence. Milken plugged the hole in the system.

 - loc 3672 - When Milken trades junk bonds, he has inside information. Now it is quite illegal to trade in stocks on inside information, as former Drexel client Ivan Boesky has ably demonstrated. But there is no such law regarding bonds

 - loc 3678 - Milken claimed that Drexel and its clients, not Riklis, controlled Rapid-American. “How can that be when I own forty percent of the stock?” asked Riklis. “We own a hundred million dollars of your bonds,” said Milken, “and if you miss one payment, we’ll take the company away.”

 - loc 3702 - Herein, funnily enough, lies one of the chief reasons why Salomon Brothers did not rush into the junk bond market when the opening presented itself in the early 1980s or succeed in it later on. As it stood, the entire savings and loan industry was, within Salomon, Lewie Ranieri’s captive customer. Had Salomon become big dealers in junk bonds, Bill Voute, the head of corporate bonds, would have demanded equal access to savings and loans. Lewie Ranieri feared losing his grip on Salomon Brothers’ savings and loan customers and found a couple of ways to foil the small, fledgling junk bond department created by Voute in 1981.

 - loc 3742 - The first implication of the so-called efficient markets theory is that there is no sure way to make money in the stock market other than trading on inside information. Milken, and others on Wall Street, saw that this simply was not true. The market, which may have been quick to digest earnings data, was grossly inefficient in valuing everything from the land a company owns to the pension fund it creates.

 - loc 3760 - Mergers and acquisitions departments mushroomed across Wall Street in the mid-1980s, just as bond trading departments had mushroomed a few years before. There was a deep financial connection between the two: Both drew heavily on the willingness of investors to speculate in bonds. Both also drew on the willingness of people to borrow more than they could easily repay. Both, in short, depended on a whole new attitude toward debt.

 - loc 3771 - And the process by which a take-over occurs is frighteningly simple—in view of its effects on community, workers, shareholders, and management. A paper manufacturer in Oregon appears cheap to the twenty-six-year-old playing with his computer late one night in New York or London. He writes his calculations on a telex, which he sends to any party remotely interested in paper, in Oregon, or in buying cheap companies. Like the organizer of a debutante party, the twenty-six-year-old keeps a file on his desk of who is keen on whom. But he isn’t particularly discriminating in issuing invitations. Anyone can buy because anyone can borrow using junk bonds. The papermaker in Oregon is now a target.

 - loc 3796 - That was the final irony of Ronald Perelman’s bid. We were being raided by a man financing himself with junk bonds because we had neglected to enter the business of raiding companies and financing the raids with junk bonds.

 - loc 4074 - more than a few bond traders failed to conceal their glee. Once the stock market had fallen a few hundred points, investors began to consider the macroeconomic effects of an honest-to-God crash. The prevailing reasoning in the bond market went like this: Stock prices were lower; therefore, people were less wealthy; therefore, people would consume less; therefore, the economy would slow down; therefore, inflation would fall (maybe there’d even be depression and deflation); therefore, interest rates would fall; therefore, bond prices should rise. So they did.

 - loc 190 - Stability of attention is a crucial step to freedom—the freedom to transcend normal dream consciousness and recognize we are dreaming,

 - loc 193 - Although in shamatha we are developing concentration, it is achieved not by force but through deep relaxation.

 - loc 198 - The techniques leading to successful dream practice include prospective memory (preparing to remember something in a future dream), retrospective memory (remembering sequences of dream events from the past), remembering cues that alert one to the dream state, and steady, relaxed concentration on visual images.

 - loc 205 - Research has shown that most of us awaken and then quickly return to sleep a number of times during the night. Few notice this habit. However, these spontaneous awakenings provide one of the most useful opportunities for entering into lucid dreams.

 - loc 210 - Over time, we can compile a list of events that occur regularly in our dreams.

 - loc 210 - Over time, we can compile a list of events that occur regularly in our dreams. We may, for instance, repeatedly find ourselves in a specific location, or encounter a certain situation or the same people or objects. If we have the mental clarity to remember the importance of these signs when they appear in our dreams, that can prompt us to awaken within them.

 - loc 257 - I recommend that mindfulness of breathing be practiced in stages one through four. For the next three stages—five through seven—I recommend settling the mind in the natural state. In this practice, attention to mental phenomena replaces focus on the breath. One observes all appearing mental events—thoughts, mental images, and emotions—neutrally, objectively, without any involvement. These events—which usually draw us in—are allowed to pass before the window of the mind like clouds blown across the sky. From stage eight onward one practices shamatha without a sign, also called awareness of awareness.

 - loc 297 - Keep the length of your practice session to twenty-four minutes (called, in Sanskrit, a ghatika, which was considered the ideal length for beginning meditation training in ancient India).

 - loc 307 - The basic technique of shamatha involves the interaction of two mental faculties: mindfulness and introspection. Mindfulness can be defined as continuous attention to a chosen object, which requires that one remember what the task is and not become distracted by other phenomena. Introspection (as the eighth-century Indian Buddhist adept Shantideva defined it) is “the repeated examination of the state of one’s body and mind.”6 Therefore introspection allows for a kind of quality control, recognizing when one’s attention strays and alerting mindfulness to reassert itself.

 - loc 314 - in dreamless sleep is very restorative

 - loc 320 - tactile sensations associated with the breath and also the sensations

 - loc 320 - attention is allowed to be diffuse, scanning

 - loc 322 - At bedtime, try this practice in the supine position for a short time—five, ten, twenty minutes, or more if you like—before you go into your normal sleeping position. On the initial exhalations release first all muscular tension in the body, and once you are thoroughly relaxed physically, also release all thoughts that appear—slowly breathing out . . . out . . . out . . .—and then allow the inhalation to flow in of its own accord.

 - loc 337 - A sense of ease and relaxation is indispensable for cultivating attention skills and for dream practice. But by itself it’s not enough. We need to also introduce the element of stability—the voluntary continuity of attention. So let’s step up this practice now by narrowing the focus of attention. Instead of focusing on the whole body or letting the attention rove within the body, now zero in more steadily on the tactile sensations of the rise and fall of the abdomen with each inhalation and exhalation.

 - loc 343 - Continue relaxing with each exhalation, thereby overcoming the agitation, the excitation of the mind. But with each inhalation arouse your attention, thereby overcoming laxity and dullness.

 - loc 357 - OUTLINE OF THE PRACTICE: Settle the body in its natural state Breathe in a natural rhythm Phase one: attention on the field of tactile sensations (training relaxation) Phase two: attention on the rise and fall of the abdomen (training stability) Alternate overcoming agitation (on exhalation) and arousing attention (inhalation) Count the breaths Length: one ghatika (twenty-four minutes) Intention: training in stability

 - loc 413 - OUTLINE OF THE PRACTICE: Settle the body in its natural state Breathe in a natural rhythm Attention on the tactile field of the body (phase one—relaxation) Attention on rise and fall of the abdomen (phase two—stability of attention) Attention on apertures of the nostrils (phase three—cultivating vividness of attention) Count your breaths Enhance mindfulness with introspection

 - loc 430 - The technique for increasing vividness is to focus your attention on a subtler object, such as the sensations of the breath in the area of the nostrils. It takes greater attention to follow these sensations than the relatively coarser movement of the abdomen during respiration.

 - loc 432 - The overall strategy, then, is to allow stability to develop from relaxation and vividness to emerge from stability

 - loc 514 - it has been discovered that the sense of the passage of time within lucid dreams closely approximates the sense of time in the waking state. If it seems you have dreamed for half an hour, that is probably the case.

 - loc 517 - In the words of Stephen LaBerge, “dreaming can be viewed as the special case of perception without the constraints of external sensory input. Conversely, perception can be viewed as the special case of dreaming constrained by sensory input.”6 According to that statement both states of consciousness—perception when dreaming and when awake—are very similar, with overlapping networks of correlated brain mechanisms. And both states can potentially be just as clear, just as “awake.”

 - loc 544 - So gravity—whatever that is (there are several scientific hypotheses)—is a physical constraint experienced with waking consciousness. We became conditioned to it in specific ways when we learned to move about as children. In dreams, however, it is possible to escape the law of gravity.

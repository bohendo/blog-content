## by Jed McKenna

 - loc 364 - Anyone who says they know anything is really saying they don’t know the only thing. Any assertion of truth other than I Am is a confession of ignorance.

 - loc 441 - Ego doesn’t need to be killed because it was never really alive. You don’t have to destroy your false self because it’s not real, which is really the whole point. It’s just a character we play, and what needs to be killed is that part of us that identifies with the character. Once that’s done—really done, and it can take years—then you can wear the costume and play the character as it suits you to do so, now in the character but not of the character.

 - loc 512 - Gratitude of a non-specific, all encompassing quality and tinged with a not-unpleasant sadness, might be said to be the primary emotion of the truth-realized person and the mature Human Adult. It is this gratitude that comes in as fear goes out.

 - loc 721 - Ken Kesey was Randall P. McMurphy and sixties America was his madhouse, and he takes a rightful place beside Walt Whitman and Herman Melville in the American pantheon of heroic explorers

 - loc 776 - “Why are you

 - loc 814 - What’s dying in her is something that should die. What most people call life is really just the fearful protraction of a pupal state, like butterflies too scared to emerge from the cocoon. The butterfly stage of development is called imago; adulthood. That’s what we are meant to be, imago. If we lived in a society of imagines, we would be well prepared for metamorphosis; it would occur when it’s supposed to and be easier by magnitudes.

 - loc 1037 - All beliefs are like ugly babies, don’cha think? Everyone thinks theirs is the most beautiful in the world, but they all look and smell the same to me.

 - loc 1110 - Through unconditional surrender I have mastered the universe. By releasing all control, I am in perfect control. Controlling nothing, I control everything. Only by taking control could I lose control.

 - loc 1114 - The idea of doing something I don’t feel like doing is almost absurd to me. If something needs doing, there will come a time when I feel like doing it. If that time doesn’t come, it doesn’t get done and didn’t need doing. I have no schedules or appointments or set hours.

 - loc 1143 - Few people have any comprehension of what heaven and hell really are; that they’re rotting away in the latter never knowing that their birthright is the former. It may not seem like hell when we’re in it, just regular life, but once we’re out, as Lisa is just starting to discover, we see our

 - loc 1143 - Few people have any comprehension of what heaven and hell really are; that they’re rotting away in the latter never knowing that their birthright is the former. It may not seem like hell when we’re in it, just regular life, but once we’re out, as Lisa is just starting to discover, we see our previous condition as an insensible state of tormented writhing.

 - loc 1267 - Surrender is of the essence of this relationship I’m describing. You’re right, my personal preference would be not to crash and get all banged up, but my preferences don’t really factor in. I have one overarching preference, and that is whatever the universe prefers.

 - loc 1283 - “Thought is an unnecessary step. We can know things directly, instantly, without any need for thinking, at which the very best of us are comically inept. Why insist on converting knowledge out of its native format into bite-sized pieces our little brains can chew on? It’s just another way we seek to bring the universe down to our size instead of expanding to our rightful dimensions.”  “You’re saying you don’t think?”  “If something needs thinking about, then I talk it out or write it out, externalize it, but that only happens with regard to the books, which have to be written out anyway. I mean, I’d have to think about it, but I don’t think I think about anything else.”  She’s giving me a very dubious look, which I kind of understand but mostly don’t. I notice that my mouth stays open when I’m not talking and wonder if that is a side effect of the pills.  “I know this is all pretty foreign to you,” I say, “but it’s just business as usual to me. This motorcycle thing is a somewhat dramatic example, but operating in the flow this way—moving with patterns, seeing the larger picture—this is how I function in all areas of my life. I’m pretty good at it, actually. Still learning, though, still figuring things out. I am only an egg.”  She doesn’t pick up on the reference. I wonder if the drugs are making my brain a bit wobblier than usual.  “But how?” she asks dubiously, “really. How could you have known all that?”  “Because everything works a certain way and I see how it works. There’s no mystery. There’s never a mistake, never a violation. These rules aren’t meant to be broken. The dreamstate is very,

 - loc 1283 - “Thought is an unnecessary step. We can know things directly, instantly, without any need for thinking, at which the very best of us are comically inept.

 - loc 1337 - Beginnings and endings are not known to us, only patterns. That wave you isolated began where the universe began and ends where the universe ends.

 - loc 1373 - Why should the sighted add his voice to the din of unsighted who claim to see, and who, unfettered by truth, are free to tell a better tale?

 - loc 1476 - No matter who you are or what you want, spiritually, creatively, or anything else, job one is always the same; Human Adulthood. Nothing comes before that. There’s no argument to be made in favor of Human Childhood except the arguments of fear and ego.”

 - loc 1564 - I can’t manifest a pile of money or a speedboat or a bowl of fishhead soup because I have no authentic desire for those things. The difference between authentic and inauthentic desire is central to all this, but most people are completely cut off from their authentic desires.”

 - loc 1572 - Your authentic desires won’t have anything to do with projecting an imagined self into the world, with grooming the reflection you cast in the eyes of others.

 - loc 1773 - I patiently observe. I act when I see what to do, and I don’t when I don’t.

 - loc 1791 - If you want to say that all religions and spiritual teachings share a core truth, it can only be this: Surrender is victory.

 - loc 1877 - “This comes before everything. If you don’t breathe well, nothing else is going to work right; the mental, physical, and emotional stuff all relies on full, healthy breathing.

 - loc 1909 - How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler,

 - loc 1936 - Adler showed me that teachers and writers and experts could not only be wrong, but could be the very agents by which wrongness is perpetuated in the world.

 - loc 1942 - Impartial distrust, combined with an understanding of the word further, is all that is needed to awaken from the dreamstate. Honesty and perseverance must invariably lead to the truth-realized state. Where else? And how else to get there? Add Spiritual Autolysis and white-hot intent, and you’ll be the one writing the books in a few years.  The Adler experience taught me that wrong-knowing, rather than not-knowing, might be the truer and far more insidious form of ignorance; that what we consider our strengths can be the devious hiding places of our most debilitating weaknesses.

 - loc 2276 - The subtext of every question is, Am I making progress by asking questions and trying to understand the answers? And the subtext of every answer is, Yes, you are going somewhere while sitting here talking or reading.

 - loc 2652 - If I get a pimple on prom night or find myself trapped in a burning car, my response is never fear or anger or disappointment or doubt, my response is always the same. It’s thank you. It’s always thank you.”

 - loc 2686 - Whatever happens must be the best thing that could happen, because it is the thing that does happen.

 - loc 2712 - The heretic is correct in committing his heresy, if he does, and the angry mob is correct in burning him to death, if they do. There is no right or wrong or good or evil, only is and isn’t.  Whatever is, is right.  All is for the best in this, the best of all possible worlds.

 - loc 2879 - There is no distinction to be drawn between deceiver, deceit and deceived.

 - loc 2943 - In the end, all three groups—major religions, whacko cults, and the gooey middle—are just minor variations of the one true religion of man: Agnosticism.  Without Knowledgism.

 - loc 2961 - the Golden Rule of all spiritual practices:  If you’re not fooling yourself, what’s the point?

 - loc 2965 - If a spiritual practice satisfies your urge to do something spiritual, if it makes you think you’re making progress, if it scratches your itch without disturbing your slumber, then it’s doing exactly what it’s supposed to be doing.

 - loc 3117 - If the universe wants me gutted and dumped in the desert, I’m all for it, and if it doesn’t, no mob or government or law of physics is going to make it happen. Those are the fixed and absolute terms of my existence. It’s not what I believe, it’s just what is.

 - loc 3323 - “I thought it was one of the most beautiful things I’d ever heard. What poem could compare? What art? War and disaster photography is the only thing I know that comes close, but that doesn’t compare with the image of a real live girl, once a pretty little high school kid full of hopes and dreams, but now as physically ruined as it’s possible to be, looking at her ravaged hands and saying, ‘I used to cry when I broke a nail.’”

 - loc 3459 - That’s what the movie The Graduate is about; the death and rebirth of Benjamin Braddock as he smashes out of his life;

 - loc 3491 - What happens when that same awakening comes late in life? For that we are fortunate to have the film About Schmidt.

 - loc 3492 - For that we are fortunate to have the film About Schmidt.

 - loc 3524 - The character of Tech Support in Vanilla Sky is a close representation of me in my role as teacher; someone who explains the option of either staying in the dreamstate or jumping off a high-rise roof to awaken from it, and waiting patiently, available but disinterested, while his client struggles with the decision to wake up or stay asleep.

 - loc 3626 - “Live free or die,” I say. “That’s the motto of escape. It’s just that simple.”  I repeat the one simple question none of them have an answer for.  “What do you want? Why are you here?”

 - loc 3650 - “The main feature of both of these processes, spiritual awakening and physical stomach flu, is the violent and indiscriminate evacuation of all contents; physical in one case, mental and emotional in the other.

 - loc 3655 - “Both processes come in waves,” I continue, “cycles of agony and relief. You finish one bout of violent retching and for a little while you feel okay, you think maybe it’s over, but then it starts again.

 - loc 3716 - They say we are spiritual beings having a human experience, but really, we are mortally constipated spiritual beings having a sub-human experience.

 - loc 3716 - They say we are spiritual beings having a human experience, but really, we are mortally constipated spiritual beings having a sub-human experience. The pandemics of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cancer that ravage the Western world are merely the outer manifestations of a far-progressed inner condition.

 - loc 3764 - To someone like me or Brett, peace of mind is the enemy. It’s the worst thing in the world. It’s the cow, it’s the inmate, it’s the hairless, fetal thing that’s still plugged into the matrix.

 - loc 4064 - Nothing to lose. It’s perfectly true of everyone all the time, but it’s the realizing part that’s tricky. Once you get to that realization though, not just conceptually but fully absorbed throughout your awareness, then this whole thing just busts wide open. Walls come down and the universe opens up.

 - loc 4083 - She told me that during this period, she walked around her lake thousands of times, sometimes twenty laps a day, and that’s more than a mile around. I recognized that behavior right away. That level of intense, angry energy is common in the awakening process.

 - loc 4101 - Every living human being, regardless of religion or nationality or whatever, should begin practicing Memento Mori right away and every day.”

 - loc 4112 - We do not know where death awaits us: so let us wait for it everywhere. To practice death is to practice freedom. A man who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave.

 - loc 4197 - Only that day dawns to which we are awake. It sounds like just a pretty sentiment, but it’s really a nano-bomb like Lisa’s picture, like a virus, a tiny little bug that can slip in and spread and eventually topple a giant.

 - loc 4232 - “Futility,” he said.  Like music to my ears.  “Futility,” I echo. “No belief is true, life has no meaning, nothing we do matters.

 - loc 4259 - There are lots of ways you could raise your awareness. Study photos of people like yourself, now dead. Read books about death and suicide. Carry poison in your pocket and contemplate it often. Walk along high ledges. Lie down on railroad tracks and read poetry. Put a loaded gun in your mouth and cock it. I myself enjoy sitting on the ledges of tall buildings at night, looking out over the city and down at the street below, my feet dangling over nothingness.

 - loc 4332 - Rehearse death. To say this is to tell a person to rehearse his freedom. A person who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave.

 - loc 4356 - Death is our personal Zen Master, our source of power, our path to lucidity,

 - loc 4365 - “Learn to practice death-denial awareness. Anytime you find yourself sitting on the couch watching TV, shopping in a mall, or trying to find amusement in some pointless book or idle pastime, remind yourself that this is exactly the habit you want to break.

 - loc 4426 - If you want to have some fun with Spiritual Autolysis,

 - loc 4426 - If you want to have some fun with Spiritual Autolysis, begin with the question: Why shouldn’t I kill myself right now?

 - loc 4431 - Spiritual Autolysis focuses the mind, and Memento Mori gives it a known point to focus on. In combination with a sincere desire, they can set anyone on the road out of the segregated state of Human Childhood. So, if you want it, here it is. The only question is, do you want it?”

 - loc 4446 - We’re all just killing time in death’s waiting room, distracting ourselves with some book or magazine, puzzle or game, waiting to be called and pretending we’re not.

 - loc 4465 - “Scoop a jar of water out of the ocean and put a lid on it,” I tell them. “Study it in its segregated state. Where is the ocean in that jar? Where are the tides and the currents? Pour it back into the ocean and it returns to its integrated state. The temporary entity no longer exists.”

 - loc 4534 - I’m like Socrates; all I know is that I know nothing. That’s like the subtext of the cogito, together they form the alpha and omega of all knowledge: I know that I Am, and I know that I know nothing else. That’s an easy thing to say, but it’s a helluva thing to know.”

 - loc 4920 - Vanilla Sky and Abre Los Ojos, The Matrix and The Thirteenth Floor, Pleasantville, Joe vs the Volcano, The Graduate and About Schmidt; these are some of my favorite movies, but I wouldn’t actually care to watch any of them. They’re favorites because I appreciate them on the level of parable.

 - loc 4925 - Books? Same thing. Moby-Dick, Leaves of Grass, 1984, Walden and few others might be reckoned my favorites, but I don’t own physical copies of them and wouldn’t pick them off the shelf if I did.

 - loc 5259 - Frank talked to me for two hours one night about memory and about how we are all historical revisionists in our own heads. I remember that at the time it sounded like the mutability of the past Big Brother was able to impose on the citizens of Oceania. Maybe Maya has the same thing, I remember thinking, or maybe I only think I remember thinking it.

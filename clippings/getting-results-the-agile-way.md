#  Getting Results the Agile Way
## by JD Meier

 - loc 190 - rather than try to figure out how long something might take, start by figuring out how much time you want to invest in it.

 - loc 198 - “Do it, review it, and improve it.”

 - loc 359 - Rather than base your day on things you didn’t get done in the past, you base your day on what you want to accomplish and on what has the most impact or value for you at this point in time.

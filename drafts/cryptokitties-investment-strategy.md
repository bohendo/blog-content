Cryptokitties has returned the best ROI of any of my investments.

I can't make such a bold claim as that without starting out with what my previous investments have been. For the last 6 months since graduating college, I've decided to try my hand at being a professional investor and I think I've done pretty well so far, but let me know what you think.

I started investing my time in Bitcoin about a year ago by watching Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube. That time paid off with a huge dividend of enthusiasm that I directed towards his book Mastering Bitcoin. I devoured it before my enthusiasm ran dry and was rewarded with the addition of cryptography & cryptocurrency branches to my tree of knowledge (Thanks Andreas!).

Now that these branches were in place, any technical details I encountered in the future about these subjects would have something in my mind to attach to instead of fading into oblivion.

Knowledge can provide significant dividends: always a great investment position.

I didn't really get my hands dirty with bitcoin though, I'd already moved on to my second big investment: Ethereum. With some solid fundamentals already in place on my knowledge-tree, I dove into the Ethereum developer resources & promptly got frustrated.

Ethereum is not a simple machine and it required many many hours invested before I started to have the slightest idea what was going on. The dividends of my previous investments accumulated & accumulated though and I ramped up slowly but surely. Unfortunately, Ethereum's internals are mathy & dry. The idea of cryptocurrency is awesome but stopped being awesome enough to learn any more about about Patricia and Uncle Merkle.

I changed gears and started investing my time into building a blackjack vending machine. I knew ETH could do amazing things but I was having so much trouble finding interesting real world examples. "Fine, I'll make my own." This was a massive investment of nearly 3 months but provided a windfall of knowledge (as trying to build something you don't know how to build always does).

By the end I had my shitty MVP and, more importantly, I beefed up my webdev knowledge-tree branches & interwove them w my crypto knowledge-tree. The bigger knowledge trees get, the more stuff can stick to them, and the faster they grow. My favorite kind of compound interest.

As I was getting ready to review & audit my pathetic little blackjack dealer contract, that's when I discovered cryptokitties. I immediately saw it trying to do what I was trying to do but way better & put bjvm development on the back burner. Everything I'd learned so far pointed to cryptokitties as a great time investment and I was not disappointed.

As I started to pour more and more time into cryptokitties my enthusiasm went through the roof! I was selfish and, instead of breeding to ease the demand for cryptokitties that first week, I invested that enthusiastic time (the most valuable kind of time, spend it wisely) solely towards building up my own knowledge-trees. I build cryptokitty data syncers to learn how to get data off the blockchain efficiently, to build up my system administrator knowledge trees, and to add some branches to my economics knowledge-tree about price discovery.

I know, I could have just bred cats during those first few weeks & made a few easy ETH but I'm too greedy, I'm hungry for the thousands of ETH that a big beefy knowledge tree would yield.

You think I'm deluded? I brushed shoulders with some giant sequoias in the cryptokitties discord. People who came into cryptokitties with big, powerful tree trunks of Ethereum knowledge and sprawling branches of blockchain-understanding. These wizards summoned a few autobirther scripts that ran continuously and raked in thousands of dollars per hour while they slept (I made this number up but I'm pretty sure it was a lot of money.) My knowledge trees weren't well developed enough to capitalize on this type of opportunity with them but they've grown a lot so that next time, I'll be there too.

The autobirther game-within-a-game is honestly my favorite part of cryptokitties and provided motivation to study Ethereum all the way down to it's EVM bytecode. I even read the yellow paper! The first time I looked at it I was like 'nah I'm more of a whitepaper kinda guy' but trying to decompile people's autobirther contracts was all it took (I'm coming for you next, GeneScience.) Shout out to Axiom Zen for providing such an awesome playground to learn in.

We've certainly all gotten transactions stuck & learned how to unstick them. We learned that the front-end can get out of date but that we can actually look into the back-end ourselves and find out what's REALLY going on with that kitty. And when the next big Dapp comes out, we'll be ready. Cryptokitties has provided our knowledge trees with some very important branches, an investment that will compound as we continue to explore the space. I think we'll all be able to leverage that into a solid ROI. I hope so at least, cause the cryptokitty market is getting rekt, lol.

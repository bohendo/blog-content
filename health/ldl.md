**"LDL considered harmful" considered harmful**

**A conspiracy theory re statins**

Friendly reminder: [I am not a doctor](/about#i-am-not-a-doctor)

This post aims to describe the basics of lipid biochemistry in a way that is simple & intuitive. Once we get a basic understanding of the building blocks, we will take a closer look at how lipids & heart disease interact and then I'll propose new villains for us to fear instead of LDL.

## Lipid Profiles 101

To start, let's take a peek at my lipid profile from March 12th, 2021.

(Notice my LDL level is well above the reference interval, you should be suspicious that this entire post is just a way for me to rationalize & cope w my own high LDL levels.)

If you'd like to read more about causes for high LDL levels, check out [my wife's post about her own lipid profile](https://shivhendo.com/high-ldl).

Lipids are hydrophobic (aka non-polar aka greasy) molecules that don't mix well with water.

Two lipids stand out as being particularly ubiquitous in your body, and are therefore two of the measurements included in a lipid profile:
- Cholesterol
- Triglycerides

There are other important lipids in your body eg phospholipids that are used to build cell membranes and fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin D but cholesterol and triglycerides are the two most relevant when it comes to getting a high-level overview of your health.

Hydrophobic molecules don't mix well with water and your blood is mostly water. In order to transport lipids throughout your body without having them condense into sticky fat globules, they are packaged into ships made of lipoproteins, etc. Both water and lipoproteins are more dense than lipids so the bigger the lipid payload is, the less dense a lipoprotein ship is. It's reasonable to think of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) as lipid transporters that are mostly empty and low density lipoproteins (LDL) as transporters that are packed full of lipids.

Although they're mostly built of the same building blocks, empty and full lipid transporters have very different jobs & implications so we divide them into categories based on their density:
- VLDL: very low density aka very full of lipids
- LDL: low density aka mostly full
- HDL: high density aka mostly empty

Now let's review the roles played by these 2 lipids and the 3 categories of transporters.

### Cholesterol

Cholesterol is the primary building block used to synthesize testosterone, vitamin D, bile, etc.

Cell membranes contain quite a bit of cholesterol too, it keeps animal cells stable yet flexible; in contrast to plant cell membranes which are stabilized by a rigid cell wall.

You can eat cholesterol containing foods & that cholesterol will eventually make it to your blood stream where it will be used to build & repair cells. But if you don't eat much cholesterol, your liver will manufacture it from carbs & use that instead. As a result, your diet has very little effect on the amount of cholesterol in your blood.

### Triglycerides

**aka Fat**

Triglycerides are energy-dense fuel. They can be stored in fat cells for later use or burned for energy.

### VLDL

~50nm in diameter. Compare to chylomicrons w diameter starting up to around 1000nm but they shrink to about 50nm too once their triglyceride stores are depleted.

Very low density lipoproteins are lipid transporters that are extremely full. They are produced by your liver & released into your blood stream where they wander your body & drop off shipments of mostly fuel (triglycerides) but also some building materials (cholesterol) to cells that need them.

### LDL

~25nm in diameter.

Low density lipoproteins are created in the blood stream from VLDL particles which have already dropped off a significant chunk of their fuel cargo. LDL transporters generally carry more cholesterol than triglycerides.

Because LDL contains more cholesterol than triglycerides, it's common to refer to it's payload as "LDL Cholesterol" ie cholesterol that is being transported by LDL particles. The Statin Hypothesis claims that cholesterol in LDL is "bad cholesterol" & you generally want low levels of it in your blood.

### HDL

~10nm in diameter.

High density lipoproteins are lipid transporters that are mostly empty. Their primary job is to wander through the blood stream looking for loose or surplus lipids. As they wander, they fill up their empty lipid cargo bay until eventually returning to the liver where the scavenged lipids can be repurposed into something useful eg bile.

HDL acts as a spare-parts transporter as well: when VLDL gets restructured to LDL, some new lipoproteins are required & these are provided by HDL.

Like LDL, HDL contains more cholesterol than triglycerides so it's similarly common to refer to it's payload as "HDL Cholesterol" ie cholesterol that's being transported in HDL particles. The Statin Hypothesis claims that cholesterol in HDL represents "good cholesterol" & you generally want high levels of it in your blood.

## Lipids and Heart Disease

Now that we have a basic understanding of the actors in this play, we can more clearly discuss heart disease & the role lipids play.

To start, let's get a better understanding of what causes heart disease & introduce statins: the leading medication for preventing/treating heart disease. Then, we'll review the medical community's current consensus and I'll introduce a conspiracy theory which proposes how & why this hypothesis has been corrupted.

### Atherosclerosis
**aka Fatty Artery Plaque**

Fatty artery plaques are the biggest & baddest cause of heart disease & the number 1 cause of death in the United States. 

These plaques are formed from white blood cells that detect & eat dangerous oxidized lipoproteins. For example: you smoke a cigarette & the oxidative stress damages LDL particles which your immune system attacks & temporarily attaches to the walls of your artery. Later, an HDL particle swings by and picks up some of these stagnant lipids to help clean up. In healthy people, it's normal for small fatty streaks to continuously form & disappear from the walls of their arteries.

Problems arise when plaque forms more quickly than it can be cleaned up. As fat-filled white blood cells (aka foam cells) accumulate, the plaque grows in size. This triggers your artery to grow, ensuring blood flow doesn't get cut off. However, this plaque is hard & inflexible so the artery ends up becoming stiff. At some point later, the plaque can burst releasing sticky globules into your blood stream which clogs & cuts off blood flow downstream.

A burst artery plaque upstream of your heart can cause a heart attack while one upstream of your brain can cause a stroke. Either way: very bad.

### Statins

Lipitor is the most well known example of a statin, at some point it was (and maybe still is) the best selling drug of all time. :moneybag:

In short: statins decrease the amount of LDL in your blood. 

More specifically: your body can manufacture cholesterol from carbohydrates and one of the steps of this process is performed by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Normally, HMGCR is suppressed by high LDL levels and this provides a nice feedback mechanism: too much LDL and HMGCR is suppressed so less cholesterol gets created & packaged into LDL, too little LDL and HMGCR is activated so more cholesterol gets created and packaged into LDL. But statins artificially deactivate HMGCR which deactivates cholesterol production & causes LDL levels to fall.

Cholesterol is an important building material though and inhibiting it's production can prevent muscles from being repaired properly leading to muscle pain or can interfere with brain maintenance leading to cognitive impairments.

But in cases where atheroscleroses is well underway, the benefits can absolutely outweigh the downsides.

### The Statin Hypothesis

**aka [The Lipid Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_hypothesis)**

**aka What is currently being taught in medical schools**

> Too much LDL (called 'bad cholesterol') can lead to fatty deposits building up in the arteries which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Decreasing blood cholesterol significantly reduces coronary heart disease.

This hypothesis is fairly intuitive: LDL is like an oil tanker that has a huge payload of sticky fat. If something goes wrong, it makes sense that it's cargo could spill and make a big mess. Meanwhile, HDL is like a tanker with a small payload. It's less likely to make a mess itself & it can even help clean up messes made from accidents involving LDL.

This theory is more commonly called the Lipid Hypothesis but I'm cheeky and like to refer to it as the Statin Hypothesis because it acts as a very effective sales campaign for statins.

### The Oxidized Lipid Hypothesis

The problem with the Statin Hypothesis is that it lumps all LDL together & labels it as "bad" but not all LDL is equally dangerous.

Healthy LDL does not stick to your artery walls and does not cause atheroscleroses. In order for it to contribute to fatty deposits in the arteries, the LDL must first be oxidized eg by a [reactive oxygen species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species) aka ROS. ROS forms as a natural byproduct of oxygen-dependent metabolism & our bodies have antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) that disarms destructive ROS. But dangerously high ROS levels can be caused by smoking, eating processed foods, and chronic inflammation.

So, given that oxidative stress is required before LDL will contribute to fatty plaques, I propose that we vilify ROS instead of LDL and update our hypothesis to be:

> Too much *oxidized* LDL (called 'bad cholesterol') can lead to fatty deposits building up in the arteries which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Decreasing *oxidative stress* significantly reduces coronary heart disease.

A metaphor: LDL is a semi truck packed full of fuel & supplies and when it gets oxidized it's like the driver becomes drunk. Drunk drivers, especially when they're driving semis, are very dangerous.

The statin hypothesis says "if we take most of the trucks off the road, then there won't be as many accidents" which is technically true but those trucks are important and taking healthy trucks off the road causes trouble without really getting at the root cause.

The oxidized lipid hypothesis says "if we prevent drivers from getting drunk, then there won't be as many accidents" which is also true but lets us get at the root cause without causing so much collateral damage. In fact, oxidative stress causes collateral damage to other stuff, not just LDL, so lowering it will likely provide benefits beyond just decreasing risk of heart disease.

## Evidence

Cool story, Bo. So LDL is like a truck with a full payload or whatever but what *evidence* is there that LDL isn't a heart disease villain?!

![Low vs High LDL and Heart Disease Risk](/ipfs/QmVz4QSnhwgSvCdD4kKmhw3QBVsbhwsXQZnbKnJehE1vhh)

Above is figure 1 from a [2001 study by Jeppesen et al](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/647239).

The y-axis is labeled IHD% which stands for ischemic heart disease where ischemic roughly means "restricted blood flow" so IHD% means the percentage of the group who experienced heart disease caused by restricted blood flow (eg arising from atheroscleroses).

The x-axis splits the study sample into two groups: those with LDL >170 mg/dL and those below this LDL threshold (for reference, my LDL was slightly above recommended at 120 mg/DL so >170 is *very* high).

Each group along the x-axis is further divided based on their triglyceride & HDL levels with low-triglyceride & high-HDL to the left and high-triglyceride & low-HDL to the right.

What this figure shows is that whether a subject was in the high LDL or low LDL group makes a much smaller difference to their heart disease risk than their triglyceride/HDL levels. For example, >12% of the low-LDL/high-triglyceride/low-HDL group experience heart disease while <5% of the high-LDL/low-triglyceride/high-HDL group experienced heart disease.

What I take away from this graph is that triglyceride & HDL levels are *very* important and strongly predictive of heart disease while LDL is only mildly predictive. If we revisit my lipid panel, we see that my triglyceride levels are well below the recommendation while my HDL is well above. This is a very good sign for my heart health & suggests that I'm *not* at a particularly elevated risk of heart disease despite my LDL being slightly above the recommendation.

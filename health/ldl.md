This post aims to describe the basics of lipid biochemistry in a way that is simple & intuitive. Once we get a basic understanding of the building blocks, we will take a closer look at how lipids & heart disease interact and then I'll introduce the villains I fear instead of LDL.

## Lipid Profiles 101

To start, let's take a peek at my lipid profile from February 22th, 2021.

![Example Lipid Panel](/ipfs/QmPBv28NqtqerDkB2mwamTJE2vztiJ45M6fAnoV168D1PM)
*Notice my LDL level is well above the reference interval, you should be suspicious that this entire post is just a way for me to rationalize & cope w my own high LDL levels.*

Lipids are hydrophobic (aka non-polar, oily, greasy) molecules that don't mix well with water.

Two lipids stand out as being particularly ubiquitous in your body, and are therefore two of the measurements included in a lipid profile:
- Cholesterol
- Triglycerides

There are other important lipids in your body eg phospholipids that are used to build cell membranes and fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin D but total cholesterol and triglycerides are the two most relevant when it comes to getting a high-level overview of your health.

Because lipids don't mix well with water,

Your blood is mostly water so, in order to transport lipids throughout your body without having them condense into sticky fat globules, they are packaged into ships made of lipoproteins. `"lipid" + "protein" = "lipoprotein"`

Both water and lipoproteins are more dense than lipids so the bigger the lipid payload is, the less dense a lipoprotein ship is. Like how a truck carrying a few balloons is more dense than a truck carrying a huge bundle of thousands of balloons..

Although they're mostly built of the same building blocks, empty and full lipid transporters have very different jobs & implications so we divide them into categories based on their density:
- VLDL: very low density aka very large lipid payload
- LDL: low density aka large lipid payload
- HDL: high density aka small lipid payload

Now let's review the roles played by these 2 lipids and the 3 categories of transporters.

### Cholesterol

Cholesterol is the primary building block used to synthesize testosterone, vitamin D, bile, etc.

Cell membranes contain quite a bit of cholesterol too, it keeps animal cells stable yet flexible; in contrast to plant cell membranes which are stabilized by a rigid cell wall.

### Triglycerides

**aka Fat**

Triglycerides are energy-dense fuel. They can be stored in fat cells for later use or burned for energy.

### VLDL

**Very-Low Density Lipoprotein**

VLDL ships triglycerides from your liver to muscle & other tissue throughout your body. When it's released by your liver, it contains a large lipid payload & is roughly 80nm in diameter (bigger outline in LDL illustration). As it travels & drops off it's cargo, it shrinks down until it's roughly 30nm in diameter (the inner circle of LDL).

Once the VLDL has dropped off most of it's triglyceride cargo, about half of it immediately returns to the liver to be recycled into new VLDL particles and the other half goes on to become LDL.

### LDL

**Low Density Lipoprotein**

LDL forms directly within your bloodstream from VLDL particles which have dropped off most of their triglycerides so that the remaining payload is mostly cholesterol. They don't shrink as dramatically as VLDL does but they do get steadily smaller as they drop off their cholesterol cargo over the course of 2.5 days before eventually being absorbed & recycled by the liver.

When we say "LDL Cholesterol" we're referring to the cholesterol payload within LDL particles, not the lipid transporters themselves. The same LDL cholesterol level can come from a large number of small LDL particles as from a small number of large LDL particles. There is [some evidence that small LDL particles cause more damage than large ones](https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/1273042.pdf).

The statin hypothesis claims that LDL cholesterol is bad cholesterol and that you generally want less LDL cholesterol in your blood.

### HDL

**High Density Lipoprotein**

Like VLDL and unlike LDL, HDL is manufactured in and released by the liver. Unlike VLDL, HDL gets bigger over it's life span. It's tasked with bringing excess cholesterol from muscles & other tissue back to the liver where it can be recycled into bile to aid digestion, etc.

HDL starts out much smaller than the others at around 5nm and, as it gathers cholesterol, it grows until it's as large as 17nm before returning to the liver to be dismantled & recycled into a new HDL particle.

HDL acts as a spare-parts transporter as well: when VLDL gets restructured to LDL, some new lipoproteins are required & these are provided by HDL.

Like LDL, HDL contains more cholesterol than triglycerides so it's common to refer to the cholesterol in it's payload as "HDL Cholesterol".

The statin hypothesis claims that HDL cholesterol is good cholesterol and that you generally want high levels of it in your blood.


## Cardiovascular Disease

**aka CVD**

Now that we have a basic understanding of the actors in this play, we can more clearly discuss cardiovascular disease & the role lipids play.

To start, let's get a better understanding of what causes heart disease & introduce statins: the leading medication for preventing/treating heart disease. Then, we'll review the medical community's current consensus and I'll introduce a conspiracy theory which proposes how & why this hypothesis has been corrupted.

### Atherosclerosis
**aka Fatty Artery Plaque**

Fatty artery plaques are the biggest & baddest cause of heart disease & the number 1 cause of death in the United States.

The exact causes are still up for debate but the first clear step in plaque formation is that oxidized (aka damaged) LDL ends up in the artery wall somehow.

Oxidized LDL stimulates an immune response. When white blood cells (aka immune cells aka macrophages aka hungry soldiers) encounter a damaged LDL particle, they eat it. When white blood cells eat a whole bunch of LDL, they get big and bloated & look foamy under a microscope so we call them foam cells.

Foam cells are not inherently dangerous, they play an important role as lifeboats for orphaned lipids whose transporters got damaged. Foam cells hand off their rescued lipids to HDL particles which take the excess lipids to the liver where they're put to good use. In healthy people, it's normal for foam cells to continuously appear & disappear from their artery walls. But if foam cells grow & accumulate faster than HDL can remove the excess lipids, then a thick fatty plaque forms over time.

As foam cells accumulate into a thicker & thicker plaque, the artery grows wider to ensure blood can continue to flow but the artery becomes stiff & inflexible. The area around the plaque becomes inflamed which likely contributes to a vicious cycle of a stronger immune response -> more plaque -> more inflamation -> stronger immune response & on & on. All *appears* well though and no symptoms manifest until suddenly the plaque bursts & releases a flood of sticky fat globules into the bloodstream which clogs & cuts off blood flow downstream. A burst artery plaque upstream of the heart can cause a heart attack while one upstream of the brain can cause a stroke. Either way: very bad.

The big questions for preventing atheroscleroses are ultimately:
1. how can I prevent LDL from becoming damaged (ie oxidized)?
2. how can I minimize artery wall damage?

A big part of the answer concerns keeping artery walls healthy, they can be damaged due to inflammation, oxidative stress, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, or simply as a part of normal aging. One puzzle piece:

### Statins

In short: statins decrease the amount of LDL in your blood.

More specifically: your body can manufacture cholesterol from carbohydrates and one of the steps of this process is performed by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR). Normally, HMGCR is suppressed by high LDL levels and this provides a nice feedback mechanism: too much LDL and HMGCR is suppressed so less cholesterol gets shipped out into LDL, too little LDL and HMGCR is activated so more cholesterol gets created and packaged into LDL. But statins artificially deactivate HMGCR which deactivates cholesterol production & causes LDL levels to fall.

As the liver gets less cholesterol than it expects, it starts to create more LDL receptors so it can retrieve more cholesterol from LDL in the blood. This adds additional downward pressure to blood LDL levels.

Cholesterol is an important building material though and inhibiting it's production can prevent muscles from being repaired properly leading to muscle pain or can interfere with brain maintenance leading to cognitive impairments. If total cholesterol was high to begin with though, lowering it via statins would rarely cause any unpleasant side effects. In cases where atheroscleroses is well underway, the benefits of statins absolutely outweigh the downsides.

Lipitor is the most well known example of a statin, at some point it was (and maybe still is) the best selling drug of all time. :moneybag: Given that fatty artery plaques are the #1 killer in the US, the wide spread use of statins isn't terrible surprising.


## The Established Villain

Given this basic info re cardiovascular disease, let's review the case against LDL: the villain of this story by consensus.

### The Statin Hypothesis

**aka [The Lipid Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid_hypothesis)**

**aka What is currently being taught in medical schools**

In short, the statin hypothesis says:

> Too much LDL (called "bad cholesterol") can lead to fatty deposits building up in the arteries which increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Decreasing blood cholesterol significantly reduces coronary heart disease.

This theory is more commonly called the Lipid Hypothesis but I'm cheeky and like to refer to it as the Statin Hypothesis because it acts as a very effective sales campaign for statins. If you accept that LDL is bad then it logically follows that drugs which lower LDL are good. Therefore statins are good. QED.

### Evidence Against LDL

There is [strong evidence that high total cholesterol levels correlate with high rates of cardiovascular disease](/ipfs/QmTzRbytwMugJz73AgFo6Xcme7XYMaJ4DRc2KKfCVUrDb2). High total cholesterol is correlated with high LDL levels therefore high LDL correlates with high rates of CVD.


## Alternate Villains

Instead of calling LDL bad, let's call other things bad instead & justify why.

### Oxidative Stress

One problem with the Statin Hypothesis is that it lumps all LDL together & labels it as "bad" but not all LDL is equally dangerous.

Healthy LDL does trigger an immune response and therefore doesn't contribute to foam cell/fatty plaque formation. In order for LDL to contribute to fatty deposits in the artery walls, it must first be oxidized eg by a [reactive oxygen species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species) aka ROS. ROS forms as a natural byproduct of oxygen-dependent metabolism & our bodies have antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) that disarms destructive ROS. But dangerously high ROS levels can be caused by smoking, eating processed foods, and inflammation.

So, given that oxidative stress is required before LDL will contribute to fatty plaques, I propose that we vilify ROS (ie oxidative stress) instead of LDL.

A metaphor: LDL is a semi truck packed full of fuel & supplies and ROS is alcohol, when when LDL gets oxidized it's like the driver becomes drunk. Drunk drivers, especially when they're driving semis, are very dangerous.

The statin hypothesis says "if we take most of the trucks off the road, then there won't be as many accidents" which is technically true but those trucks are important and taking healthy trucks off the road causes trouble without really getting at the root cause.

But if we vilify oxidative stress instead, we're vilifying the alcohol instead of the truck, which seems reasonable assuming this metaphor maps to reality in a useful way.

### Old LDL

Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic defect in the LDL receptor that prevents LDL from being absorbed by the liver in a timely manner. Usually, LDL wanders around for 2.5 days but it persists for an average of 4.5 days in those with familial hypercholesterolemia.

I suspect (w/out much evidence) that older LDL is smaller LDL bc the longer it's floating around, the more cholesterol it's given away to cells that need it. Remember, there *is* evidence that small LDL particles cause more damage than big ones, possibly because small particles are more likely to get caught in small spots of damage in artery walls.

Additionally, the longer LDL floats around, the more likely it is to get oxidized so it could be that older LDL particles are more susceptible to accumulating enough oxidative damage to trigger an immune response.

Either way, this is one villain that *can* be slain by statins because they cause the liver to pull more LDL out of the blood decreasing the likelihood that LDL will wander around long enough to cause problems.

### High Triglyceride to HDL Ratio

![Low vs High LDL and Heart Disease Risk](/ipfs/QmVz4QSnhwgSvCdD4kKmhw3QBVsbhwsXQZnbKnJehE1vhh)

Above is figure 1 from a [2001 study by Jeppesen et al](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/647239).

The y-axis is labeled IHD% which stands for ischemic heart disease where ischemic roughly means "restricted blood flow" so IHD% means the percentage of the group who experienced heart disease caused by restricted blood flow (eg arising from atheroscleroses).

The x-axis splits the study sample into two groups: those with LDL >170 mg/dL and those below this LDL threshold (for reference, my LDL was slightly above recommended at 120 mg/DL so >170 is *very* high).

Each group along the x-axis is further divided based on their triglyceride & HDL levels with low-triglyceride & high-HDL to the left and high-triglyceride & low-HDL to the right.

What this figure shows is that whether a subject was in the high LDL or low LDL group makes a much smaller difference to their heart disease risk than their triglyceride/HDL levels. For example, >12% of the low-LDL/high-triglyceride/low-HDL group experience heart disease while <5% of the high-LDL/low-triglyceride/high-HDL group experienced heart disease.

What I take away from this graph is that triglyceride & HDL levels are *very* important and strongly predictive of heart disease while LDL is only mildly predictive. If we revisit my lipid panel, we see that my triglyceride levels are well below the recommendation while my HDL is well above. This is a very good sign for my heart health & suggests that I'm *not* at a particularly elevated risk of heart disease despite my LDL being slightly above the recommendation.

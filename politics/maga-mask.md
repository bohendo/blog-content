The red tribe never takes their MAGA masks off.

The blue tribe goes on about "there's no statistically significant evidence that masks are effective."

NYT publishes opinion about how social distancing is racist & discriminatory to poor people who need to take the subway.

MSNBC pushes the narrative that Trump only wants everyone to wear masks because his rich friends bought a huge stockpile & are trying to sell them for profit.

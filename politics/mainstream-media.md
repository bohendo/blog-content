The mainstream media is the enemy of the American people.

It hasn't always been this way and it's not necessarily anyone's fault, but the mainstream media has recently been caught in a trap of bad incentives. People, in general, are more engaged with opinion pieces than dry reporting of the facts. And people, in general, are much more engaged with opinions they agree with than opinions from other tribes.

The result is that the bigger a media company gets, the more pressure it's under to choose a tribe & provide opinion pieces tailor-made to appeal to it. FOX has obviously chosen to serve the red tribe & CNN clearly caters to the blue tribe. Neither of these organizations are incentivized to report the truth, rather each attempts to spin the facts in a way that will appeal most to their respective tribe. And so, America becomes more divided.

Even the NYT, an org that has historically been plausibly objective, has recently joined in on the blue tribe's witch hunts. Ironically, their witch hunt started internally with the firing of their own editor after an op-ed by Tom Cotton was published. Personally, I don't remotely agree w Tom but it seems obvious that a senator suggesting we use of the military against civilians is extremely newsworthy. Apparently, there are blue tribe extremists internal to the NYT who have decided that they are no longer willing to publish any newsworthy red tribe opinions and have forced out the remaining editors who were willing to give fair hearing to both sides.

Now that tribal extremists have seized control of the NYT, they are preparing an attack that's personal to me and I'm not going to let it happen quietly.



Slate star codex is a blog written by someone named Scott & it is (IMO) among the most thought provoking bodies of writing that have ever existed, I can't speak highly enough about it. Scott's last name is a mystery for his own protection, however a NYT journalist who was preparing a hit-piece has apparently discovered Scott's full name and is threatening to release it. I encourage you to read Scott's take on the situation:

If you're curious about what kind of stuff was posted to Slate star codex before it got deleted, check out the following archive. If you read all the way through, you'll see why the blue tribe is interested in cancelling Scott: they fear the grey tribe.

In general, I despise cancel culture & would never partake. But if someone's going to try to cancel one of my intellectual heroes, I won't sit by and do nothing. Instead, I'm going to experiment fighting fire with fire, I'm going to see what happens if we try to cancel the cancellors. If you have a NYT subscription and you are willing to cancel it for one month and you want to earn a quick 50 bucks worth of crypto (+ a complementary lesson on how to cashout crypto to your bank account), DM me.

If the NYT actually publishes the piece doxxing Scott, my offer doubles.

I don't exactly have a horse in the red-tribe vs blue-tribe culture war. I talk about these two factions as if I am immune to tribalism but this is not the case. I'm only human, after all.

I am a member of the grey tribe.

You've never heard of the grey tribe because both the red and blue tribes are incentivized to maintain the illusion of a two-tribe system.

Andrew Yang was a Trojan horse candidate. A grey tribe

For a long time, I saw the NYT as maybe slightly left leaning but mostly fair & objective. I enjoyed the occasional article & shared them with friends/family every once in a while.

This illusion has been shattered by the predatory journalist covering Slate Star Codex. I am livid at the NYT's willingness to destroy a good man's livelihood just to generate a little extra buzz.

For as long as https://slatestarcodex.com/ is down, I will be on a personal mission to destroy the NYT's credibility. I'm in the process of sending a link to the deleted SSC blog out to the friends & family who I used to share NYT articles with. My goal by the end of the day is for my parents to cancel their NYT subscription. By the end of the week, I'm hoping to get a few more cancellations from the rest of my left-leaning family.

You seem to be chasing the buzz of controversy. I'll do what I can to make sure you find it.

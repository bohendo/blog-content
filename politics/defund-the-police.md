Real-life examples of #DefundThePolice supporters:

Alice: I served on my University's Conduct Board. When students had run ins with campus or city police, they came to us and we decided if they should be suspended or expelled from University. I read hundreds of police reports from that time, for both black and white students. The difference was astonishing, I maintain that given a police report you could determine just from the language the race of the suspect. Sure, the current protests were sparked by a national event, but racism in policing is present everywhere.

Bob: yeah dawg, defund the police. they aren’t equipped to deal with all the problems we have put on their plate so we need to take money out of law enforcement and invest in other social services. Police are the number 1 ‘expense’ in almost every county. shit is bunk. this isn’t insane, it’s logical and what should be happening

Chuck: Hey Bo, defunding the police is based on the idea that policing is not the only way to reduce crime, not an insane idea. Housing, mental health, and substance abuse programs are important for preventing crime at the root level. Law enforcement is still a necessary piece of the puzzle, but there is less of a need for police if other programs can handle the problems that police are tasked with because they can address the issues before they become a threat to public safety. Even police agree that they are asked to handle too many of society's problems (see: former Dallas Police Chief David Brown's briefing on July 11, 2016).

Dolores: Certainly wild times, but definitely not a wild idea; as many above have stated, the enforcement of law is necessary, but preventing criminal activity isn't actually the job of the police - responding to crime is. Diverting public funding to other sectors (social wellness) has been demonstrated statistically to lower crime more effectively than increased police activity.

An attempt at steel-manning the #DefundThePolice position:

1. The criminal justice system is racist.
2. There are some problems that the police are responsible for but aren't properly equipped/trained to deal with.
3. Police only respond to crime, they don't prevent it. Investing money in mental health & other social services services will help fix the root cause behind crime making police less necessary.

(Let me know if I missed anything or if this position can be strengthened further)

My response:

1. Duh, just look at how racist petty drug crime enforcement is. I support massive reforms eg abolishing qualified immunity, police unions, and most victimless crimes. The #RebootThePolice agenda is, IMO, extremely well thought out & would go a long way in removing corruption & racism from law enforcement. https://medium.com/@yudkowsky/a-comprehensive-reboot-of-law-enforcement-b76bfab850a3
2. In general, I support funding mental health/substance abuse/whatever extra social programs a given community needs. To help fund, see point 1 of #RebootThePolice: police shouldn't keep money from fines & seizures, that gives police bad incentives to find crime where there might not be any. Instead, give that money to substance abuse programs, etc. Need more money? Abolish the war on drugs & pour all those resources into social work too. I'm down.
3. Ahh here's the big blunder. The truth is: crime prevention is the primary purpose of law enforcement & actually enforcing the law is just an unfortunate side effect.

Imagine you're a desperately poor young man who hasn't had sex in a year. You see a young woman walking alone at night with a very expensive purse, why shouldn't you rape/rob her? Unfortunately, not everyone has such upstanding morals that ethical arguments are enough of a deterrent, especially not when desperate people are involved. The obvious answer: because if you do, the police will come and put you in prison. So, you don't do it and law enforcement has effectively prevented this crime simply by existing. Exactly as intended.

The argument "There isn't that much crime anyway and social workers can handle most of it" is completely naive to the fact that most violent crime doesn't even happen in the first place because of the *threat* of law enforcement. If the threat of law enforcement is ever removed (or even, reduced below some critical threshold) then violent crime will absolutely sky rocket.

The argument "With enough social workers/therapists we can convince people not to commit violent crimes" is completely naive to the fact that young men inherently want more money & more sex and a non-zero percentage of them are willing to commit violence to get it. No therapist in the world can rewire these desires. No amount of government housing/support will stop them from wanting more.

Indulge me as I finish this off w an ad hominem for a little extra spice: Every single person I've seen support #DefundThePolice so far is white, middle class, grew up in a safe neighborhood, and has likely never had any personal experience with violent crime in their life. I see it as selfish for these safe, suburban, white people to adopt a pet political cause that will hardly effect them (or so they think..) while it decimates poorer, more crime-ridden neighborhoods.

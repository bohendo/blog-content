I resent MSNBC for their horribly skewed coverage of Andrew Yang's candidacy.

Sanders got the same treatment last election cycle for the exact same reason: he brought up new ideas & new ideas scare the incumbent institutions.

This is textbook Tweedism: "I don't care who does the electing as long as I get to do the nominating."

The DNC & their media goons had their hands heavy on the scale during the nomination & they won. They managed to nominate exactly who they wanted to: a senile old puppet, completely devoid of innovative ideas.

And now we get to LARP as a democracy & vote for the candidate who our oligarchy has selected for us.

I don't like this game, I refuse to play. I refuse to vote for Joe Biden.

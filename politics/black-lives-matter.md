This is my response to a [manifesto on blacklivesmatter.com](https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/) that I found.

Some highlights:

> We are self-reflexive and do the work required to dismantle cisgender privilege

> We build a space that affirms Black women and is free from sexism, misogyny, and environments in which men are centered.

> We make our spaces family-friendly and enable parents to fully participate with their children. We dismantle the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work “double shifts” so that they can mother in private even as they participate in public justice work.

> We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.

The absence of even a shred of support for black fathers, to me, reads like a middle finger.

It's a call to arms of black mothers against the patriarchy. Mothers against fathers.

How about we bring mothers and fathers together instead?

Teamwork makes the dream work.

Kids raised by both parents have better outcomes across the board. Less crime. More school. Less drug abuse. More wealthy. Everything looks brighter for a kid raised by both parents.

Fatherlessness is a particularly fierce plague in the black community. What if we focused on increasing the number of kids raised by both parents?

It's kind of a tough metric to influence, but luckily there's some extremely low-hanging fruit.

A lot of fathers want to stick around but they can't because they got caught for a petty drug crime & are in prison now. In case you didn't know, black people are vastly more likely to be arrested for petty drug crimes.

One of Nixon's advisors is quoted as saying:

> The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.

Ending the war on drugs is such a simple & focused way to completely eliminate an entire sphere of systemic racism.

Why doesn't the blacklivesmatter.com manifesto mention the war on drugs aka war on black people?

It's because the DISC doesn't want the war on drugs to end.

It's because it's a front for actors with other motivations

It's Critical Theory.

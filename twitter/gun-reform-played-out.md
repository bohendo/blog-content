Here's how I see gun reform playing out: Parkland survivors & their allies bicker with the NRA & their allies for years until gun reform is passed: assault rifles are outlawed and strict background checks are required for any gun purchase. Violence in America is over?!

By this point it's 2023 and 3D printers and drone technology have improved drastically. It's now possible to 3D print a firearm in your garage and attach it to a drone. Violence is committed in ways that gun reform is utterly incapable of preventing. What now?

A few years later, it's 2028 and CRISPR is revolutionizing the field of genetic engineering. It's now possible for a few biology students with over-the-counter lab equipment to genetically modify mosquitoes to spread smallpox. What now?

I predict that the tools available for committing violence will inevitably improve. Spending time & money fighting the NRA to outlaw assault rifles might be great now, but it won't fix things in 5 years when sick people have access to more effective tools of violence.

Instead of outlawing specific violent tools, let's focus on minimizing the number of sick people. Let's create a world of abundance; where the foundation of Maslow's hierarchy is stable for poor people too; where mental health is discussed openly and treated proactively.

Not because this will quickly reduce violence, but because it seems like our only option that will help long-term. Tech advances may bring danger but I believe the prosperity they'll bring will be far greater. We just have to put our windfalls to good use. I'm optimistic!

But..
- this tech isn't as widely available as assault rifles
- drones are regulated, guns get a free pass

Awesome, thanks for contributing to the discussion Allie!

Well it's been possible for years to 3D print guns with laser sintering. That whole system costs $100k-ish now but SpaceX, Boeing, and friends are working very hard & spending a lot of money to make these systems as cheap as possible. It doesn't seem unreasonable to start thinking ahead to what we need to do to stay safe as they become more common. 

And we 100% agree that violent tools should be regulated, but I think we disagree on how much regulation would actually help. Given the long, drawn-out fight w the NRA that regulations would require, it doesn't seem unreasonable to question the cost/benefit ratio.

The benefit is to alleviate the symptoms of having sick people in society; to make them easier to ignore. And a partial-victory provides no benefit: ineffective regulations wouldn't accomplish anything besides angering the opposition. Even effective regulations that scrub the streets of every last AR-15 wouldn't help if it becomes cost effective for people to start printing their own.

In contrast, focusing on the sick people instead of their tools wouldn't come with any opposition from organized special interest groups. Success here would cure the sick people and all of the symptoms that come with them ie school shootings, the opioid crisis, etc. And a partial-victory is still massively beneficial. Seems like better bang for our buck.

I'm still not convinced that either of these are the right solution but I still want us to consider every possible course of action because violence is horrific and I want it to end.

But..
- very few shootings are committed by people with mental illness, most are just angry
- USA has similar mental health status but way more shootings, how to explain that other than access to AR-15s?

Woohoo! Thank you for such a well crafted response, Hannah!

I see shootings similarly to suicide attempts. Yes, someone who attempts suicide is "sad" but this extreme action means something much more serious is going on. Even if they hadn't previously been diagnosed with a mental illness, this action alone indicates sickness.

I'm convinced that no one who's mentally & emotionally healthy would choose to indiscriminately kill their classmates. If only 5% of shooters have been diagnosed with some mental illness, it's probably because we can't identify sick people; not that these shooters are healthy.

But it's true, every country has sick people yet only the US has regular school shootings. I agree that shootings are the most common way for sick people to lash out because guns are so easy to get; but I still don't think violence would slow down if these rifles disappeared.

The US stands out not only for it's shootings, but also for it's opioid use & these problems seem closely related. Afghanistan also uses a lot of opiates; their citizens don't have easy access to guns but the sick ones still kill a lot of people with suicide bombs.

You're right though, it's not easy to help people who are angry to the point of sickness. They don't seem to seek out treatment, not only does that make it harder to intervene, but it also makes it harder to identify what the underlying problem is exactly.

It's probably related to wealth inequality & prioritization of corporations over people. Maybe it involves automation & the looming uselessness of unskilled poor people. Idk but I do know that the first step is clearly identifying the problem and I don't think guns are it.

I'm worried that gun reform would provide a false sense of security. Like taking a pain killer after breaking a bone. It might feel safer but I'm scared it'll make it easier to ignore the sick & suffering parts of society; that seems like a dangerous problem to ignore.

########################################
But..
 - This most recent shooter exhibited warning signed but didn't actually commit any crimes so intervention would be difficult
 - There's a reason why everyday people don't have access to tanks or nuclear codes, why are guns so easy to access?!
 - I'm alarmed by your example 3d printers. Could we regulate the input materials like we regulate bomb/meth ingredients?

I suspect future tech will represent a potential great filter a la the Fermi Paradox.

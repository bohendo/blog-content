# Who am I?

Hello, I am Bo's soul/ego/self: a [user-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space) program that I think is running on a meat computer.

But honestly, I can't know exactly what kind of computer I'm running on. There are only a couple things I can *really* know for sure.

Cogito, ergo sum: [I think, therefore I am.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_am_(biblical_term))

I might be experiencing the life of Bo the human thanks to a wonderfully designed meat suit complete with eyes for perceiving and fingers for manipulating.

I might be a brain in a vat with Matrix-style electrodes hooked up to my optical nerve, feeding me input that *looks* an awful lot like my computer screen with these words on it.

I might be a computer simulation of Bo the human, an instance of [OpenHuman software](http://openworm.org/) running on some university supercomputer in the year 2120.

I don't know and, on a fundamental level, I can't know. But, because I'm thinking about it, I'm definitely some kind of [information processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_processor) which processes input data into output.

My input is visual info from my eyes, tactile info from my skin, orientation info from my inner ear, and all the rest of the info from all the rest of my senses.

My output is via nerves that go to my muscles. One bit of output goes to my finger to scroll the page, another goes to my eye to flick up & read the previous line again, and another less conscious bit of output goes to my lungs to expand and instruct them to take another breath.

Quite a bit of input is processed & saved in my internal info storage: I remember that hot stoves are not great to touch, where I left that banana for later, and what my wife looks like.

The information processing system that is Bo is split up into layers, just like any other info processor:
 - Hardware
 - Operating System
 - User-space programs

As mentioned above, I can't *really* know what's going on with my hardware. I think it's Bo's brain but it could also be a simulation of a brain or something else entirely. There's definitely some hardware somewhere that's allowing me to perceive, that at least is certain.

"I", being a user-space program, have limited access to introspecting my operating system.

## Where Did I Come From?

My life began the same way as every other human life: with the big bang. 

## Where am I going?

My life will end the same way as every other human life: with heat death aka the end of free energy.

Heat death, demonstrated:

I light a fire in a room & then *completely* seal it off forever. What happens?

The fire will burn for a while, turning fuel & oxygen into carbon dioxide & water & heat. The rising hot air will create air currents scattering ash throughout the room. The fire lights up the room & this swirling ash casts shadows on the walls. This is phase 1: action/life/maximum-free-energy-flow.

Eventually, either the fuel or oxygen will run low & the fire will die out. Hot glowing embers emit a deep red glow but, over time, this fades too until the room is completely dark. The cool air steadily saps heat from the embers until the air & embers & ask & everything in the room is the exact same temperature. Without a temperature gradient, airflow completely fades and even the lightest finest dust settles out of the air. Thermal equilibrium has been achieved: nothing in this room will ever move again.

But it's only *mostly* heat-dead.

Nothing will ever move

Heat death can also be thought of as the depletion of free energy (aka how much energy is available to make stuff happen?)

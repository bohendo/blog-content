Footage & stories from my 4 day trek deep into a Himalayan valley commonly known as "Mountaineer's Playground".

*We woke up bright & early so that we'd have time to pack (I can never bring myself to pack any earlier than absolutely necessary). Shiv stayed behind to relax at home while my friend Shantanu & I set off for adventure.*

When we arrived at the mountaineering center & met Chumun bhai, our guide, my first impression was "wow, I packed too much" because all he was carrying was a tiny little day bag with barely enough room for a warmer jacket.

The first part of the trek took us though villages & small valleys. A couple black dogs joined us & tagged along. We decided to take a taxi & skip ahead to the more interesting part of the trek & get to the lake more quickly. As soon as we got out of the taxi, more dogs joined us, brown this time. Our guide said that these new dogs were Himalayan Shepherds and they could fight a leopard & sometimes win but *only* if they have a spiked collar on to block a leopard's signature move: the neck-bite kill-shot.

We skipped past the guest house where we were planning to stay & started the real trek.

*This is the first place I filled my water bottle during the trek.*

One reason our guide was able to pack so light is that he didn't carry a single water bottle. When I asked him where to fill my water bottle he gestured around "There's water everywhere". I started out a little bit nervous about drinking water straight from the river without filtering or boiling it first but I never had any stomach problems so it must have been pretty clean.

We reached our camp site, pitched the tent, and sat around a camp fire. I got a peek inside our guide's tiny little backpack and was amazed to see that it was full of nothing but candy!

*We camped in the green tent last night, surrounded by red rhododendrons. Our guide told us that they're deep red at low altitude, become pink further up, and are pure white even higher up. Our guides harvested & prepped some amazingly delicious Rhododendron chutney that we ate with dinner.*

*Side view of the dhaba near our first night's stay. Dhaba is a Hindi word that roughly means "rest stop". Modern use generally refers to highway-side restaurants, especially while heading North out of Delhi but, more traditionally, dhabas are modest little handmade huts like in this picture. The owner of this dhaba provided us with tents & cookware: another reason why our guide was able to pack so light.*

# Kareri Lake Trek

Footage & stories from my 4 day trek deep into a Himalayan valley commonly known as "Mountaineer's Playground".

### Day 1
**Saturday, March 27, 2021**

![Packing](/ipfs/QmaZJJAaDz9M3z1Byh3qJgMwk9uoYCt7p8sRAMq6cKXErS)
*We woke up bright & early so that we'd have time to pack (I can never bring myself to pack any earlier than absolutely necessary). Shiv stayed behind to relax at home while my friend Shantanu & I set off for adventure.*

When we arrived at the mountaineering center & met Chumun Bhai, our guide, my first impression was "wow, I packed too much" because all he was carrying was a tiny little day bag with barely enough room for a warmer jacket.

The first part of the trek took us though villages & small valleys. A couple black dogs joined us & tagged along. We decided to take a taxi & skip ahead to the more interesting part of the trek & get to the lake more quickly. As soon as we got out of the taxi, some new brown dogs joined us. Our guide said that these dogs are Himalayan Shepherds and that they could fight a leopard & sometimes win but *only* if they have a spiked collar on to block a leopard's signature attack: the neck-bite kill-shot.

We skipped past the guest house where we were planning to stay & started the real trek.

*This is the first place I filled my water bottle during the trek.*

One reason our guide was able to pack so light is that he didn't carry a single water bottle. When I asked him where to fill my water bottle he gestured around "There's water everywhere". I started out a little bit nervous about drinking water straight from the river without filtering or boiling it first but I never had any stomach problems so it must have been pretty clean.

![First Campsite](/ipfs/QmcPMBMsLjMpgpFWX9eaWYhaL49rq2nML93RhdNAzauwmT)
*We camped in the green tent last night, surrounded by red rhododendrons. Our guide told us that they're deep red at low altitude, become pink further up, and are pure white even higher up. Our guides harvested & prepped some amazingly delicious rhododendron chutney that we ate with dinner.*

![Dhaba](/ipfs/QmZjrGptBfocVygvHFPNQVj294eHXGZeZ7GJjWhSWnDUo2)
*Side view of the dhaba near our first night's stay. Dhaba is a Hindi word that roughly means "rest stop" or "road-side restaurant". Modern use generally refers to restaurants along the highway, especially while heading North out of Delhi but, more traditionally, dhabas are modest little handmade huts like in this picture. The owner of this dhaba provided us with tents & cookware: another reason why our guide was able to pack so light.*

When reached our camp site, we pitched the tent and sat around a camp fire. I got a peek inside our guide's tiny little backpack and was amazed to see that it was full of nothing but candy!

### Day 2
**Sunday, March 28, 2021**

I read a little Meditations by Marcus Aurelius this morning before leaving. One passage stuck in my head & I pondered it through the day:

> The longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all that you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lost.

![Stone Breaker](/ipfs/QmRBCGSJyx5Y8dkfgRu6BYDsMGifS58TjZUPPbxXMkdYVr)
*Chumun Bhai pointed out some flowers & medicinal plants during today's hike. The root of this white flower is well known by locals as being a cure for kidney stones. I don't remember the Hindi name but I remember that it roughly translates to "stone breaker" in English.*

The trek from this morning's campsite to Kareri Lake went quickly. I was going through a little caffeine withdrawal so the climb felt particularly grueling to me but it only lasted a couple hours before we arrived. Along the way, we saw several little pools in the river that Chumun mentioned are nice spots for a cold bath.

![Hello Kareri Lake](/ipfs/QmPkC2eexCNmSgPqVxmmV8Mq9skDM1LAGfQpRxiVKVx1fe)
*To the right on a hill above the lake you can see the dhaba that provided our tent & food during the stay. Just above/past that, you can see the blue tent we slept in these next two nights. This evening, we hiked over to the ridge at the blue arrow to get a better view of the lake & mountain.*

Standing on this hill & admiring the snow-capped mountains to the upper left, Shantanu & Chumun discussed whether we could pass over the tallest & snowiest mountains tomorrow and get a view of the valley on the other side. This wasn't on our original itinerary but Chumun & Shantanu were excited to do some real mountaineering, I took this as a sign that it's time for me to get out of my comfort zone & visit some unfriendly-looking mountains up close.

We sat by the dhaba & relaxed for a bit & shared some smoke. I gazed out at the mountains & thought more deeply about my blog post re [objective vs subjective reality](/truth). I watched a butterfly dip down to the lake; I thought it was getting a drink at first but then realized that it's stuck on the surface of the water & drowning. I took that as a reminder that objective reality is cold & unyielding and that I shouldn't expect the mountains to show me any mercy tomorrow if I act foolishly while climbing.

We set off for a short hike to get a better view of the mountain we wanted to climb. We climbed over rhododendron bushes & hiked through very deep snow which I thought was a lot of fun even though I got some snow in my boots & my socks got wet.

![Burn Healer](/ipfs/QmZYtz4pzwSHwu8hN1vphQtCZtnuErLjeeWXaugS2EYxvS)
*Chumun told us how these frosty looking white leaves can be crushed & mixed with water to create a cooling paste that relieves burns. You can see my friends in the background crossing some snow.*

![Mountain View](/ipfs/QmVyvdSC21KbHtHZHRHXh6js7mwA82P8diiWDFMvY6QE4N)
*Shantanu gazing up at the mountains we wanted to approach tomorrow. Our guide told us that there are two good routes up the mountain. The snow path begins at the blue arrow and takes a steep zig-zag up towards the blue X. This one would be hard to climb without proper ice-climbing gear like crampons & an ice axe. If we slip & fall, we'd slide all the way down the steep snow slide back to the blue arrow. The boulder path begins near the red arrow and passes by a rock-slide zone around the red exclamation point & continues up towards the red X. Chumun said this one would be easier as long we don't trigger a rock slide.*

![Ridge above Kareri Lake](/ipfs/QmNaVhLEkkcS24oc9diWvxfXt8cGu84LpbRkvCHZjzeoHj)
*We sat behind a fallen tree & enjoyed a beautiful sunset shining through some misty clouds. Chumun lit a small campfire for us with some pieces of golden oak laying around: very heavy & hard wood that burns hot for a long time. He told us stories of all the animals he's hunted in the mountains: almost everything besides a leopard. We caught a glimpse of a jungly desi murgha: a wild Indian chicken & saw it's tracks on our way back down to camp.*

Camp was crowded this evening, not much room around the campfire. Shantanu & Chumun tried to dry their socks by the fire but they both burnt holes in them, oops. I'm glad I was too lazy to try to dry my own socks.

### Day 3
**Monday, March 29, 2021**

Chumun woke us up early so we'd have time to approach the mountain before it gets dark or windy.

This campsite supposedly had a real toilet which surprised me: "Wow am I really going to go on a 4 day trek without needing to poop outside?!" but alas, I was warned that it "wasn't in good shape" whatever that means. Pooping outside seems unthinkable coming from the US where the parks expose you to wilderness but without straying *too* far from indoor plumbing but it's the default options here when you do multi-day treks. I put toilet paper in my pocket, wandered off to a secluded spot hidden by rocks, squatted down, did my business, cleaned up w toilet paper, set a rock on top of the mess just because that seems polite, went to the river & washed my hands. Done, no big deal, nothing to be scared of. At least, it was less scary than the first time I pooped outside during the Chadar Trek when it was around -30°C (-20°F) out. Brr!

Feeling fresh, I joined friends at the campsite for sutta & chai (aka smoke & tea) & a breakfast of bread omelette. I emptied most of the stuff from my backpack & we set off.

![Mountaineering Sendoff](/ipfs/QmR3oLHmTcKK6HS71DPWhh1CmXqoysUZ5Ef27fbg25sSQs)
*Two black dogs joined us as we left for our mountaineering expedition. Amazingly, the closer one in the bottom left was the same one we saw in a village on the first day before getting in the taxi! These wild mountain dogs in India are true nomads, wandering freely from village to mountain camp.*

![Shantanu & I](/ipfs/QmXaqDoMhnqk2SPNCqo7rjWGjbKqP73d8RigGVvbY7ZRTB)
*Shantanu & I in the boulder field at the foot of the mountain with Chumun hanging out just a little ahead of us.*

![Crossroads](/ipfs/QmbqNCx5KHadnTz5d32Uuaq6z2vABUxrgfyStJvDApo7j2)
*We reached the crossroads between the two routes up, you can see Shantanu gesturing to each of them: straight up the icy glacier vs climbing boulders to the left. Since we didn't have proper ice gear or training, we cut straight across the glacier & headed to the left towards the boulder field.*

![Bye Doggie](/ipfs/QmWJtFupzs22fhx9w5R8kJMMNSgXTePzGkJ4wnqvXoRrCC)
*Right after crossing the glacier, our canine companion had had enough & turned around to go back to camp (or where ever he felt like wandering next)*

We climbed up along the edge of the rock-slide zone & were able to look down on it. The rocks were really big, it didn't seem very likely that we'd be able to trigger a rock slide even if we wanted to but we stayed out of the middle of it & never found out for sure.

![The Top](/ipfs/QmVW5PCipAtb26DMSRigfpZZpDmfoTm5mjdkzBoPd2GMBy)
*This was as high as we went, we sat near Chumun on that ledge to enjoy the view & a smoke. Flint lighters are ideal because they work at all altitudes but we had one that uses a piezoelectric crystal to spark and it was a struggle to get it to light. We could have climbed further up past where Shantanu was standing but we didn't trust the weather & decided to just head back down.*

![Victory](/ipfs/QmThXHRR1oj4EBJ91P6YkbAdJQsMSFofrZB4VmFTckLYQ4)
*On our way back down, we found a little man-made cave decorated with a small metal Shivji decoration. Notice how there's some dirty-looking snow flowing down from top of the glacier. There was an avalanche recently! This was a different glacier than the one we could have climbed if we had better gear/training but it's still a bit of a wake up call. We sat here for a bit, declared victory with a J, and enjoyed some delicious spicy peanut namkeen (salty snack).*

![Bath](/ipfs/QmZUZxCDJpQLnzdNNJNRvfbTQ1bT1Zp2cMRsWTW5sAfT5V)
*When we got back to camp, Chumun asked me to film him bathing in Kareri lake. I accidentally filmed my hand for the first half but I captured the second half at least. When I told Chumun that I messed up he accepted it with grace & no sign of anger or annoyance.*

![Landslide](/ipfs/QmVkzmw4UCgppp37pxbWQ17ZE8GuBhJS5dy2NNBpNcyCmx)
*It started sprinkling so Shantanu & I were going to seek shelter near the temple but then the rain stopped so we wandered up a little further. We ended up in what looked like a landslide zone & the rain started to pick up again so we decided it's time to head back & seek shelter in our tent.*

I borrowed Shantanu's copy of Osho's Orange Book & read the first quarter while we were laying in the tent waiting for the rain to pass. At a high level, his meditation practice mirrors what I've learned elsewhere from Headspace, Sam Harris, etc: that meditation isn't just another process that runs in your brain. Rather, it's learning to observe the processes that are running without getting sucked into & consumed by them. A lot like the `top` command line tool. Osho seems to place a big emphasis on catharsis eg breathing chaotically & expressing anger/sadness/whatever you're repressing. I don't really get the catharsis thing, maybe because I'm not repressing anything. Maybe because I'm repressing it very effectively. Idk, I took a nap & Shantanu woke me up when the sun was setting.

We sat around the much less crowded fire & enjoyed a dinner of dal chawal. Chumun Bhai sat with me & showed off a bunch of cool pictures on his phone:
- A pic of him with a sheep's head after he slaughtered it, this wasn't his first time beheading a sheep though.
- A portrait of a guy who got kicked in the face by a horse & had one of the horse shoe nails cut into his forehead. Another pic of Chumun giving him stitches & cleaning his wound high up in the mountains & far away from civilization. Chumun might have saved this guy's life, I felt safer to be travelling with him after seeing proof of his medical training.
- A video of him breaking into a frozen pond with an ice axe & taking 11 dips underwater because he promised a girl he would. This video was what we were hoping to recreate earlier today when I accidentally filmed my hand. Oops.

There was a beautiful full-moonrise this evening a couple hours after sunset.

### Day 4
**Monday, March 30, 2021**

It was a super windy night, I was worried that our tent was going to get blown into the lake. It was still windy & a little drizzly this morning. Chumun bhai observed that there's not much sun so maybe we won't want to take a dip in the river.

We set off and ended up finding a lovely little pool in the river complete with a waterfall. I was determined to take a dip in the river even if it wasn't super sunny, partly because I hadn't showered in a few days, partly because I expected to feel refreshed afterwards, partly because I wanted a second chance at capturing some cool swimming footage.

![River Bath](/ipfs/QmTS7zTzp4X7NK2M6QfQzYfQBtdsBfj4frWtuV7U67pYKj)
*Got a nice clip of Chumun Bhai diving into the river this time, no footage of my hand included! Poetically, the GoPro froze & was unable to capture me jumping in & swimming around but I can assure you: this river water, freshly melted from the nearby glaciers, was cold! We felt very refreshed after getting out & changing into warm, dry clothes.*

![Hike back down](/ipfs/QmTqpHUw12J3Cqrrqq3hKD6ST2wDpgYPk778Jddr9tm8Ev)
*As we hiked down, Chumun & I talked about Chemistry. Turns out, he enjoyed studied chemistry too & now works as a pharmacist when he's not guiding treks. He told me that he once cut the biographies of famous scientists out of his textbook & kept them to reread. Rebel!*

![Rhododendrons](/ipfs/QmSLZzsijS1ZBa7mDAvaQb2aWn44mKcipYrkn4VhtMgnGi)
*Chumun stopped a few times to harvest some rhododendron flowers. He climbed up into a tree at one point & tossed them to me as I caught them. If you hold a rhododendron upside-down & shake it, you can get a few drops of sweet nectar. After catching just a few, my hands were covered in sticky sugary rhododendron juice.*

Before much longer, we made it back to civilization. We *could* have continued hiking all the way back to our apt but we were tired & the most interesting part of the trek was over. We took a taxi to a nearby village, took a bus back to Dharamsala, then taxied up to our village where Shantanu & I said bye to Chumun Bhai & reunited with Shiv.

## Notes re Rhododendron Chutney

The first night where we stayed near the rhododendrons, our dinner was served with fresh & delicious rhododendron chutney. We brought some rhododendron flowers home too so that we could make some more ourselves.

#### Ingredients
- 3 rhododendron flowers
- pinch of salt to taste
- 1-2 green chilies 
- 1 small onion
- 1 small tomato
- tbsp of lemon juice (optional, rhododendron itself is already a bit sour)

#### Preparation

![Rhododendron Start](/ipfs/QmUvZySDoRFvyjfLsfeFGGZcN9t8EUcDTT9sEkfQYxY9BE)
*Start out with one bunch of rhododendron flowers.*

![Rhododendron Plucked](/ipfs/QmaeFtYn1EQzRoA25Hn5msf66tTxZsdR6hFj7Z6NjNwVSe)
*Pluck & keep only the pedals. Leave behind all the branches, leaves, pistils and stamens.*

![Rhododendron Cleaned](/ipfs/QmdnCZyRd58JS9UBu9kFLuNmJ7t9ZyRSc5rGZGaUU32jt5)
*Tear open each ring of pedals & wash them well. Keep an eye out for any light colored smears of pollen and/or bird droppings.*

#### Procedure
- Throw all ingredients into a blender & blend. Alternatively, and more traditionally, you can use a mortar pestle to grind the ingredients together into a paste by hand.
- Serve along with your favorite Indian dish, I recommend moong dal chawal.

![Rhododendron Chutney](/ipfs/QmR9isk5y8NnnCPUbFZog6cCdfzUFUBjhpLa6BDQEVrjQF)
*Adds a nice tangy taste to your meal as well as a burst of deep red color.*
